1.A.1.1.1	
2 TMS K+ and water channel (conducts K+ (KD = 8 mM); blocked by Na+ (190 mM) (Renart et al., 2006) and tetrabutylammonium (Iwamoto et al., 2006)). Ion permeation occurs by ion-ion contacts in single file fashion through the selectivity filter (Köpfer et al. 2014). A narrow pore lined with four arrays of carbonyl groups is responsible for ion selectivity, whereas a conformational change of the four inner transmembrane helices (TMS2) is involved in gating (Baker et al. 2007). Two gates have been identified; one is located at the inner bundle crossing and is activated by H+ while the second gate is in the selectivity filter (Rauh et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain mediates pH modulation (Hirano et al., 2011; Pau et al., 2007). KcsA exhibits a global twisting motion upon gating (Shimizu et al., 2008).  Activity is influenced by the phase of the lipid bilayer (Seeger et al. 2010), and occupancy of nonannular lipid binding sites increases the stability of the tetrameric complex (Triano et al. 2010).  The open conformation of KcsA can disturb the bilayer integrity and catalyze the flipping of phospholipids (Nakao et al. 2014).  This protein is identical to the KcsA orthologue (P0A333) in Streptomyces coelicolor.  The stability of the pre domain in KcsA is stabilized by GCN4 (Yuchi et al. 2008).  The potential role of pore hydration in channel gating has been evaluated (Blasic et al. 2015).  Having multiple K+ ions bound simultaneously is required for selective K+ conduction, and a reduction in the number of bound K+ ions destroys the multi-ion selectivity mechanism utilized by K+ channels (Medovoy et al. 2016).  The channel accomodates K+ and H2O molecules alternately in a K+-H2O-K+-H2O  series through the channel (Kratochvil et al. 2016). Insertion of KcsA is spontaneous and directional as the cytosolic part of the protein does not translocate across the membrane barrier. Charged residues, not hydrophobic residues, are crucial for insertion of the unfolded protein into the membrane via electrostatic interactions between membrane and protein.  A two-step mechanism was proposed. An initial electrostatic attraction between membrane and protein represents the first step prior to insertion of hydrophobic residues into the hydrocarbon core of the membrane (Altrichter et al. 2016). Bend, splay, and twist distinguish KcsA gate opening, filter opening, and filter-gate coupling, respectively (Mitchell and Leibler 2017). Details of the water permeability have been presented. Water flow through KcsA is halved by 200 mM K+ in the aqueous solution, which indicates an effective K+ dissociation constant in that range for a singly occupied channel. (Hoomann et al. 2013).

1.A.1.10.1	
Voltage-sensitive Na+ channel, NaV1.7 (Cox et al., 2006). The human orthologue, SCN3A when mutated causes cryptogenic pediatric partial epilepsy (Holland et al., 2008). Batrachotoxin (BTX) is a steroidal alkaloid neurotoxin that activates NaV channels through interacting with transmembrane domain-I-segment 6 (IS6) of these channels. Ginsenoside inhibits BTX binding (Lee et al. 2008). VGSCs are heterotrimeric complexes consisting of a single pore-forming alpha subunit joined by two beta subunits, a noncovalently linked beta1 or beta3 and a covalently linked beta2 or beta4 subunit (Hull and Isom 2017).

1.A.1.10.12	
Type 2 Na+ channel, SCN2A or NaV1.2, of 2,005 aas and 24 TMSs.  Mutations give rise to epileptic encephalophathy, Ohtahara syndrome (Nakamura et al. 2013). They may also give rise to autism (ASD) (Tavassoli et al. 2014). This protein is orthologous to the rat Na+ channel, TC# 1.A.1.10.1 and very similar to the type 1 Na+ channel (1.A.1.10.7). NaV1.2 has a single pore-forming alpha-subunit and two transmembrane beta-subunits. Expressed primarily in the brain, NaV1.2 is critical for initiation and propagation of action potentials. Milliseconds after the pore opens, sodium influx is terminated by inactivation processes mediated by regulatory proteins including calmodulin (CaM). Both calcium-free (apo) CaM and calcium-saturated CaM bind tightly to an IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the alpha-subunit. Thermodynamic studies and solution structure (2KXW) of a C-domain fragment of apo 13C,15N- CaM (CaMC) bound to an unlabeled peptide with the sequence of the rat NaV1.2 IQ motif showed that apo CaMC (a) was necessary and sufficient for binding, and (b) bound more favorably than calcium-saturated CaMC. CaMN  apparently does not influence apo CaM binding to NaV1.2IQp (Mahling et al. 2017).

1.A.1.10.3	
Ca2+-regulated heart Na+ channel, Nav1.5, SCN5A or INa channel of 2016 aas. The COOH terminus functions in the control of channel inactivation and in pathologies caused by inherited mutations that disrupt it (Glaaser et al., 2006); regulated by ProTx-II Toxin (Smith et al. 2007), telethonin, the titin cap protein (167aas; secreted protein; O15273) (Mazzone et al., 2008), and the Mog1 protein, a central component of the channel complex (Wu et al., 2008). Nav1.5, the principal Na+ channel in the heart, possesses an ankyrin binding site, and direct interaction with ankyrin-G is required for the expression of Nav1.5 at the cardiomyocyte cell surface (Bennett and Healy, 2008; Lowe et al., 2008). Mutations cause type 3 long QT syndrome and type 1 Brugada syndrome, two distinct heritable arrhythmia syndromes (Mazzone et al., 2008; Kapplinger et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2015). SCN5A mutations causing arrhythmic dilated cardiomyopathy, commonly localized to the voltage-sensing mechanism, and giving rise to gating pore currents (currents that go through the voltage sensor) have been identified (McNair et al., 2011; Moreau et al., 2014).  Patients with Brugada syndrome are prone to develop ventricular tachyarrhythmias that may lead to syncope, cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death (Sheikh and Ranjan 2014) and (Kapplinger et al. 2015). Mutations causing disease have been identified (Qureshi et al. 2015). These give rise to arrhythias and cardiomyopathies (Moreau et al. 2015).  Mutations that cause relative resistance to slow inactivation have been identified (Chancey et al. 2007).  Green tea catechins are potential anti-arrhythmics because of the significant effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (E3G) on  cardiac sodium channelopathies that display a hyperexcitability phenotype (Boukhabza et al. 2016). A mutatioin, R367G, causes the familial cardiac conductioin disease (Yu et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain of calmodulin (CaM) binds to an IQ motif in the C-terminal tail of the alpha-subunit of all NaV isoforms, and contributes to calcium-dependent pore-gating in some (Isbell et al. 2018). Ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) is often initiated by premature ventricular contractions, and the presence of SCN5A mutations increases the risk upon exposure to sodium channel blockers in patients with or without baseline type-1 ECG (Amin et al. 2018). A mutation (R367G) is associated with familial cardiac conduction disease (Yu et al. 2017).

1.A.1.10.5	

Voltage-sensitive Na channel, type 9, a-subunit, Nav1.7 or SCN9A (orthologous to 1.A.1.10.1). Loss of function, resulting from point mutations, results in a channelopathy called Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIP) (He et al. 2018), that causes the congenital inability to experience pain (Cregg et al., 2010; Kleopa, 2011). An S241T mutation causes inherited erythromelalgia IEM; erythermalgia, an autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to mild warmth (due to altered gating) (Lampert et al., 2006; Drenth and Waxman, 2007). Gain-of-function mutations in the Na(v)1.7 channel lead to DRG neuron hyperexcitability associated with severe pain, whereas loss of the Na(v)1.7 channel in patients leads to indifference to pain (Dib-Hajj et al., 2007). Blocked by 1-benzazepin-2-one (Kd = 1.6 nM) (Williams et al., 2007). Mutations in the Nav1.7 Na channel a-subunit give rise to familial pain syndromes called chronic non-paoxysmal neuropathic pain (Catterall et al., 2008; Fischer and Waxman, 2010; Dabby et al. 2011 ). It interacts with the sodium channel beta3 (Scn3b), rather than the beta1 subunit, as well as the collapsing-response mediator protein (Crmp2) through which the analgesic drug lacosamide regulates Nav1.7 current (Kanellopoulos et al. 2018). The R1488 variant is totally inactive (He et al. 2018). Nav1.7 is inhibited by knottins (see TC# 8.B.19.2) (Agwa et al. 2018). Nav1.7 interacts with the following proteins: syn3b (TC# 8.a.17.1.2; the ß3 subunit), Crmp2, Syt2 (Q8N9I0) and Tmed10 (P49755), and it also regulates opioid receptor efficacy (Kanellopoulos et al. 2018).

Muscle plasmalemma, voltage-gated, L-type dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+ channel, a-1 subunit (DHPR) (Ba2+ > Ca2+), Cav1.1, CACNA1S,CACH1 CDCN1, CACNL1A3 of 1873 aas in the human orthologue.  Distinc voltage sensor domains control voltage sensitivity and kinetics of current activation (Tuluc et al. 2016).

1.A.1.11.26	
Two pore Ca2+ > Na+, Li+ or K+ (non-selective for these three monovalen caions) channel protein of 733 aas and 12 TMSs, TPC1 (Guo et al. 2017). The crystal structure of this vacuolar two-pore channel, a homodimer, has been solved (Guo et al. 2015) (Kintzer and Stroud 2016). Activation requires both voltage and cytosolic Ca2+. Ca2+ binding to the cytosolic EF-hand domain triggers conformational changes coupled to the pair of pore-lining inner helices from the first 6-TMS domains, whereas membrane potential only activates the second voltage-sensing domain, the conformational changes of which are coupled to the pair of inner helices from the second 6-TMS domains. Luminal Ca2+ or Ba2+ modulates voltage activation by stabilizing the second voltage-sensing domain in the resting state and shift voltage activation towards more positive potentials. The basis for understanding ion permeation, channel activation, the location of voltage-sensing domains and regulatory ion-binding sites is partially explained by the 3-d structure (Kintzer and Stroud 2016). Only the second Shaker domain senses voltage (Jaslan et al. 2016).

1.A.1.11.27	
Voltage-dependent P/Q-type Ca2+ channel subunit a1A, CACNA1A (CACH4; CACN3; CACNL1A4) of 2,505 aas.  90% identical to 1.A.1.11.8.  Associated with four neurological phenotypes: familial and sporadic hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1, SHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) and epileptic encephalopathu with nerve atrophy (Reinson et al. 2016). A gain of function mutation gave symptoms of congenital ataxia, abnormal eye movements and developmental delay with severe attacks of hemiplegic migraine (García Segarra et al. 2014).


PBDID: 3BXK
1.A.1.11.4	
The voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel a-subunit-1C (L-type Cav1.2), CACNA1C (CACH2, CACN2, CACNL1A1, CCHL1A1) of 2221 aa. Mutations cause Timothy's syndrome, a disorder associated with autism (Splawski et al., 2006). The C-terminus of Cav1.2 encodes a transcription factor (Gomez-Ospina et al., 2006). Cav1.2 associates with the a-2, d-1, ß and ? subunits (Yang et al., 2011). The CRAC channel activator STIM1 binds and inhibits L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, Cav1.2 (Park et al., 2010).  This channel appears to function as the molecular switch for synaptic transmission (Atlas 2013). Intramembrane signalling occurs with syntaxin 1A for catecholamine release in chromaffin cells (Bachnoff et al. 2013).  miR-153 intron RNA is a negative regulator of both insulin and dopamine secretion through its effect on Cacna1c expression, suggesting that IA-2beta and miR-153 have opposite functional effects on the secretory pathway (Xu et al. 2015).   Co-localizes with Syntaxin-1A in nano clusters at the plasma membrane (Sajman et al. 2017). It is a high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel in contrast to Cav3.3 which is a low voltage-activated Ca2+ channel (Sanchez-Sandoval et al. 2018). Nifedipine blocks and potentiates this and other L-type VIC Ca2+ channels (Wang et al. 2018).

6TMS K+ channel (Kuo et al., 2003).  The kch gene, the only known potassium channel gene in E. coli, has the property to express both full-length Kch and its cytosolic domain (RCK) due to a methionine at position 240. The RCK domains form an octameric ring structure and regulate the gating of the potassium channels after having bound certain ligands. Several different gating ring structures have been reported for the soluble RCK domains.  The octameric structure of Kch may be composed of two tetrameric full-length proteins through RCK interaction (Kuang et al. 2013).

2 TMS ( P-loop) Ca2+-gated K+ channel, MthK (see Jiang et al., 2002 for the crystal structure, and Parfenova et al., 2006 for mutations affecting open probability). For the studies of ion permeation and Ca2+ blockage, see Derebe et al., 2011. (structures: 3LDD_A and 2OGU_A.). Voltage-dependent K+ channels including MthK which lacks a canonical voltage sensor can undergo a gating process known as C-type inactivation, which involves entry into a nonconducting state through conformational changes near the channel's selectivity filter (Thomson and Rothberg, 2010). C-type inactivation may involve movements of transmembrane voltage sensor domains.

Voltage-gated Na+ channel, NavCh. 3d-structure known (3ROW; Payandeh et al., 2011). An anionic coordination site was proposed to confer Na+ selectivity through partial dehydration of Na+ via its direct interaction with conserved glutamate side chains. The pore is preferentially occupied by two ions, which can switch between different configurations by crossing low free-energy barriers (Furini and Domene, 2012). Jiang et al. 2018 presented high-resolution structures of NavAb with the analogous gating-charge mutations that have similar functional effects as in the human channels that cause hypokalaemic and normokalaemic periodic paralysis.

Bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav.  The 3-d crystal structure of the open-channel conformation is known (McCusker et al. 2012).  It has its internal cavity accessible to the cytoplasmic surface as a result of a bend/rotation about a central residue in the carboxy-terminal TMS that opens the gate to allow entry of hydrated sodium ions. The molecular dynamics of ion transport through the open conformation has been analyzed (Ulmschneider et al. 2013).  The C-terminal four helix coiled coil bundle domain couples inactivation with channel opining, depedent on the negatively charged linker region (Bagnéris et al. 2013).

Tetrameric 6 TMS subunit Na+ channel protein, NaV.  Two low resolution cyroEM structures revealed two conformations reconstituted in lipid bilayers (Tsai et al. 2013). Despite a voltage sensor arrangement identical with that in the activated form, Tsai et al. 2013 observed two distinct pore domain structures: a prominent form with a relatively open inner gate, and a closed inner-gate conformation similar to the first prokaryotic Nav structure. Structural differences, together with mutational and electrophysiological analyses, indicated that widening of the inner gate was dependent on interactions among the S4-S5 linker, the N-terminal part of S5 and its adjoining part in S6, and on interhelical repulsion by a negatively charged C-terminal region subsequent to S6 (Tsai et al. 2013).

6 TMS cell volume sensitive, voltage-gated K+ channel, KCNQ4 or Kv7.4 (mutations cause DFNA2, an autosomal dominant form of progressive hearing loss) (forms homomers or heteromers with KCNQ3) (localized to the basal membrane of cochlear outer hair cells and in several nuclei of the central auditory pathway in the brainstem). Four splice variants form heterotetramers; each subunit has different voltage and calmodulin-sensitivities (Xu et al., 2007).  Autosomal dominant mutant forms leading to progressive hearing loss (DFNA2) have been characterized (Kim et al. 2011). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) impact ion channel function (Taylor and Sanders 2016).

K+ voltage-gated channel, LQT-like subfamily; Kv7.1; KvLQT1; KCNQ1 (regulated by KCNE peptides which affect voltage sensor equilibrium; Rocheleau and Kobertz, 2007). Almost 300 mutations of KCNQ1 have been identified in patients, and most are linked to the long QT syndrome (LQT1), some in the voltage sensor (Peroz et al., 2008; Eldstrom et al. 2010; Qureshi et al. 2013; Ikrar et al. 2008). KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes may interact intermittently with the actin cytoskeleton via the C-terminal region (Mashanov et al., 2010). The stoichiometry of the KCNQ1 - KCNE1 complex is flexible, with up to four KCNE1 subunits associating with the four KCNQ1 subunits of the channel (Nakajo et al., 2010). A familial mutation in the voltage-sensor of the KCNQ1 channel results in a cardiac phenotype (Henrion et al., 2012). KCNQ1 regulates insulin secretion in the MIN6 beta-cell line (Yamagata et al., 2011; Gofman et al., 2012).  Electrostatic interactions of S4 arginines with E1 and S2 contribute to gating movements of S4, but coupling requires the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) as voltage-sensing domain activation failed to open the pore in the absence of PIP2 (Zaydman et al. 2013). The D242N mutation causes impaired action potential adaptation to exercise and an increase in heart rate. Moreover, the D242 amino acylposition is involved in the KCNE1-mediated regulation of the voltage dependence of activation of the KV7.1 channel (Moreno et al. 2017). The KCNQ1 channel interacts with MinK (KCNE1) to cause pore constriction, generating the slow delayed rectifier (IKs) current in the heart (Jalily Hasani et al. 2018).

The archaeal voltage-regulated K channel, KvAP (Ruta et al., 2003). X-ray and solution structures are available. The latter shows phospholipid interactions with the isolated voltage sensor domain (Butterwick and MacKinnon 2010; Li et al. 2014). The gating-charge arginine in TMS4 of the voltage sensor forms part of the helical hairpin "paddle", and it moves 15-20 Å through the membrane to open the pore (Ruta et al., 2005). The orientation and depth of insertion of the voltage-sensing S4 helix has been determined (Doherty et al., 2010). A synthetic S6 segment derived from the KvAP channel self-assembles, permeabilizes lipid vesicles, and exhibits ion channel activity in bilayer lipid membrane (Verma et al., 2011).  Thus the gating mechanism combines structural rearrangements and electric-field remodeling ( Li et al. 2014).  KvAP has been reconstituted in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) (Garten et al. 2015).  TMS4 (S4) which senses voltage also promotes membrane insertion of the voltage-sensor domain (Mishima et al. 2016). KvAP has a configuration consistent with a water channel, possibly underlying the conductance of protons, and other cations, through voltage-sensor domains (Freites et al. 2006).

1.A.1.2.10	
Voltage-gated K+ channel, chain A, Shaker-related, Kv1.2 (Crystal structure known, Long et al., 2007; Chen et al. 2010). Functions with the auxiliary subunit, Ivß1.2; 8.A.5.1.1) (Peters et al. 2009).  Delemotte et al. (2010) described the effects of sensor domain mutations on molecular dynamics of Kv1.2.  The Sigma 1 receptor (Q99720; Sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1) interacts with Kv1.2 to shape neuronal and behavioral responses to cocaine (Kourrich et al. 2013).  Amino acid substitutions cause Shaker to become heat-sensing (opens with increasing temperature as for TrpV1) or cold-sensing (opens with decreasing temperature as for TrpM8) (Chowdhury et al. 2014).  The Shaker Kv channel was truncated after the 4th transmembrane helix S4 (Shaker-iVSD) which showed altered gating kinetics and formed a cation-selective ion channel with a strong preference for protons (Zhao and Blunck 2016).  Direct axon-to-myelin linkage by abundant KV1/Cx29 (TC# 1.A.24.1.12) channel interactions in rodent axons supports the idea of an electrically active role for myelin in increasing both the saltatory conduction velocity and the maximal propagation frequency in mammalian myelinated axons (Rash et al. 2016). A cryoEM structure (3 - 4 Å resolution; paddle chimeric channel; closed form) in nanodiscs has been determined (Matthies et al. 2018). Possible gating mechanisms have been discussed (Kariev and Green 2018).

Voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.1 or KCNA1. Regulated by syntaxin through dual action on channel surface expression and conductance (Feinshreiber et al., 2009).  Defects cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an autosomal dominant K+ channelopathy accompanied by short attacks of cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria (D'Adamo et al. 2014). Direct axon-to-myelin linkage by abundant KV1/Cx29 channel interactions in rodent axons supports the idea of an electrically active role for myelin in increasing both the saltatory conduction velocity and the maximal propagation frequency in mammalian myelinated axons (Rash et al. 2016). Kv1.1 is present in bull sperm where it is necessary for normal sperm progressive motility, per cent capacitated spermatozoa (B-pattern) and the acrosome reaction (Gupta et al. 2018).Gating induces large aqueous volumetric remodeling (Díaz-Franulic et al. 2018).

The voltage-gated K+ channel subfamily D member 3, KCND3 or Kv4.3.  Mutations cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 19 (Duarri et al. 2012). Positively charged residues in S4 contribute to channel inactivation and recovery (Skerritt and Campbell 2007). The crystal structure of Kv4.3 with its regulatory subunit, Kchip1, has been solved (2NZ0) (Wang et al. 2007).

Margatoxin-sensitive voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.3 (in plasma and mitochondrial membranes of T lymphocytes) (Szabò et al., 2005). Kv1.3 associates with the sequence similar (>80%) Kv1.5 protein in macrophage forming heteromers that like Kv1.3 homomers are r-margatoxin sensitive (Vicente et al., 2006). However, the heteromers have different biophysical and pharmacological properties. The Kv1.3 mitochondrial potassium channel is involved in apoptotic signalling in lymphocytes (Gulbins et al., 2010). Interactions between the C-terminus  of Kv1.5 and Kvß regulate pyridine nucleotide-dependent changes in channel gating (Tipparaju et al., 2012).  Intracellular trafficking of the KV1.3 K+ channel is regulated by the pro-domain of a matrix metalloprotease (Nguyen et al. 2013).  Direct binding of caveolin regulates Kv1 channels and allows association with lipid rafts (Pérez-Verdaguer et al. 2016). Addtionally, NavBeta1 interacts with the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of Kv1.3 through W172 in the transmembrane segment to modify the gating process (Kubota et al. 2017). During insertion of Kv1.3, the extended N-terminus of the second a-helix, S2, inside the ribosomal tunnel is converted into a helix in a transition that depends on the nascent peptide sequence at specific tunnel locations (Tu and Deutsch 2017). The microRNA, mmumiR449a, reduced the mRNA expression levels of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1), and calcium activated potassium channel subunit alpha1 (KCNMA1) and increased the level of transmembrane phosphatase with tension homology (TPTE) in the DRG cells (Lu et al. 2017). This channel is regulation by sterols (Balajthy et al. 2017). Loss of function causes atrial fibrillation, a rhythm disorder characterized by chaotic electrical activity of cardiac atria (Olson et al. 2006). The N-terminus and S1 of Kv1.5 can attract and coassemble with the rest of the channel (i.e. Frag(304-613)) to form a functional channel independently of the S1-S2 linkage (Lamothe et al. 2018).

Voltage-gated K+ channel, Shaker. Shaker and Shab K+ channels are blocked by quinidine (Gomez-Lagunas, 2010). Also regulated by unsaturated fatty acids (Börjesson and Elinder, 2011).  TMSs 3 and 4 comprise the voltage sensor paddle (Xu et al. 2013).  Partially responsible for action potential repolarization during synaptic transmission (Ford and Davis 2014). Shaker K+ channels can be mutated in S4 to create an analogous ""omega"" pore (Held et al. 2018).

K+ voltage-gated ether-a-go-go-related channel, H-ERG (KCNH2; Erg; HErg; Erg1, Kv11.1) subunit Kv11.1 (long QT syndrome type 2) (Gong et al., 2006; Chartrand et al. 2010; McBride et al. 2013).  Forms a heteromeric K+ channel regulating cardiac repolarization, neuronal firing frequency and neoplastic cell growth (Szabó et al., 2011). Oligomerization is due to N-terminal interactions between two splice variants, hERG1a and hERG1b (Phartiyal et al., 2007). Structure function relationships of ERG channel activation and inhibition have been reviewed (Durdagi et al., 2010). Interactions between the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane core modulate hERG K channel gating (Fernández-Trillo et al., 2011). The marine algal toxin azaspiracid is an open state blocker (Twiner et al., 2012). Verapamil blocks channel activity by binding to Y652 and F656 in TMS S6 (Duan et al. 2007).  Hydrophobic interactions between the voltage sensor and the channel domain mediate inactivation (Perry et al. 2013), but voltage sensing by the S4 segment can be transduced to the channel gate in the absence of physical continuity between the two modules (Lörinczi et al. 2015).  Mutations give rise to long QT syndrome (Osterbur et al. 2015).  Polyphenols such as caffeic acid, phenylethyl ester (CAPE) and curcumin inhibit by modification of gating, not by blocking the pore (Choi et al. 2013). Potassium ions can inhibit tumorigenesis through inducing apoptosis of hepatoma cells by upregulating potassium ion transport channel proteins HERG and VDAC1 (Xia et al. 2016).  Incorrectly folded hERG can be degraded by Bag1-stimulated Trc-8-dependent proteolysis (Hantouche et al. 2016). The S1 helix regulates channel activity. Thus, S1 region mutations reduce both the action potential repolarizing current passed by Kv11.1 channels in cardiac myocytes, as well as the current passed in response to premature depolarizations that normally helps protect against the formation of ectopic beats (Phan et al. 2017). Interactions of beta1 integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulate distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 (Becchetti et al. 2017). ERG1 is sensitive to the alkaloid, ginsenoside 20(S) Rg3 which alters the gating of hERG1 channels by interacting with and stabilizing the voltage sensor domain in an activated state (Gardner et al. 2017). Channels split at the S4-S5 linker, at the intracellular S2-S3 loop, and at the extracellular S3-S4 loop are fully functional channel proteins (de la Peña et al. 2018). IKr is the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, the ion current largely responsible for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Inherited forms of long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans are linked to functional modifications in the Kv11.1 (hERG) ion channel and potentially life threatening arrhythmias. hERG1b affects the generation of the cardiac Ikr and plays an important role in cardiac electrophysiology (Perissinotti et al. 2018).

K+ voltage-gated channel, rEAG1; Kv10.1; rat ether a go-go channel 1 (962 aas). Blocked by Cs+, Ba2+ and quinidine (Schwarzer et al., 2008). Cysteines control the N- and C-linker-dependent gating of KCNH1 potassium channels  (Sahoo et al., 2012).  The 3-d structure has been determined at 3.8 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-EM with calmodulin bound. The structure suggests a novel mechanism of voltage-dependent gating. Calmodulin binding closes the potassium pore (Whicher and MacKinnon 2016).

The electron crystalographic structure is available (PDB 4CHW)revealing ligand-induced structural changes (Schünke et al. 2011; Scherer et al. 2014; Kowal et al. 2014).

Cryo electron microscopic structures of the chicken orthologue at 4.5 Å resolution has been solved, revealing a large cytoplasmic gating ring in which resides the Na+-binding site and a transmembrane domain that closely resembles voltage-gated K+ channels (Hite et al. 2015).

Orthologue K+/Na+ pacemaker channel, Hcn4 (Scicchitano et al., 2012).  Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated HCN channels underlie the Na+-K+ permeable IH pacemaker current. As with other voltage-gated members of the 6-transmembrane KV channel superfamily, opening of HCN channels involves dilation of a helical bundle formed by the intracellular ends of S6, but this is promoted by inward, not outward, displacement of S4. Direct agonist binding to a ring of cyclic nucleotide-binding sites, one of which lies immediately distal to each S6 helix, imparts cAMP sensitivity to HCN channel opening. At depolarized potentials, HCN channels are further modulated by intracellular Mg2+ which blocks the open channel pore and blunts the inhibitory effect of outward K+ flux. Lyashchenko et al. 2014 showed that cAMP binding to the gating ring enhances not only channel opening but also the kinetics of Mg2+ block.  Mutations in HCN4 cause sick sinus and the Brugada syndrome, cardiac abnormalities. Associated withfamiial sinus bradycardia (Boulton et al. 2017).

Elastic network model analysis of the CNGA3 channel supports a modular model of allosteric gating, according to which protein domains are quasi-independent: they can move independently but are coupled to each other allosterically (Gofman et al. 2014).

Hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated K+ channel, HCN (bCNG-1) (PNa+/PK+  0.3). The human orthologue (O88703) is 863 aas in length and also catalyzes mixed monovalent cation currents K+:Na+= 4:1 (Lyashchenko and Tibbs et al., 2008). Biel et al. (2009) presented a detailed review of hyperpolarization-activated cation-channels. They are inhibited by nicotine and epibatidine which bind to the inner pore (Griguoli et al., 2010). They control cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity. HCN channels contain cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBDs) in their C-terminal regions, linked to the pore-forming transmembrane segment with a C-linker. The C-linker couples the conformational changes caused by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to the HCN pore opening. Cyclic dinucleotides antagonize the effect of cyclic nucleotides in HCN4 but not in HCN2 channels. Interaction of the C-linker/CNBD with other parts of the channel appears to be necessary for cyclic-dinucleotide binding in HCN4 channels (Hayoz et al. 2017).

TWIK-1 (KCNK1, HOHO1, KCNO1) inward rectifier K+ channel (Enyedi and Czirják, 2010) expressed in the distal nephron segments (Orias et al. 1997).  Lipid tails from both the upper and lower leaflets can partially penetrate into the pore (Aryal et al. 2015). The lipid tails do not sterically occlude the pore, but there is an inverse correlation between the presence of water within the hydrophobic barrier and the number of lipids tails within the lining of the pore (Aryal et al. 2015).

TREK-1 (KCNK2) K+ channel subunit (Regulated by group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and by diacylglycerols and phosphatidic acids) (Chemin et al., 2003). TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK are all regulated by lysophosphatidic acid, converting these mechano-gated, pH voltage-sensitive channels into leak conductances (Chemin et al., 2005). The mammalian K2P2.1 potassium channel (TREK-1, KCNK2) is highly expressed in excitable tissues, where it plays a key role in the cellular mechanisms of neuroprotection, anaesthesia, pain perception and depression (Cohen et at., 2008). Alternative translation initiation in rat brain yields K2P2.1 potassium channels permeable to sodium (Thomas et al. 2008). The crystal structure of the human 2-pore domain K+ channel, K2P1 has been solved (Miller and Long, 2012). Multiple modalities converge on a common gate to control K2P channel function (Bagriantsev et al., 2011).  TREK-1 mediates fast and slow glutamate release in astrocytes upon GPCR activation (Woo et al. 2012). It is a mechanosensitive K+ channel, present in rat bladder myocytes, which is activated by swelling and arachidonic acid (Fukasaku et al. 2016). The M2-hinges of TREK-1 and TREK-2 channels control their macroscopic current, subcellular localization and gating (Zhuo et al. 2017). The human ortholog has acc # O95069 and has an additional N-terminal 15 aas. BL-1249, a compound from the fenamate class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is known to activate K2P2.1(TREK-1), the founding member of the thermo- and mechanosensitive TREK subfamily (Pope et al. 2018).

Outward rectifying mechanosensitive 2-P (4 TMS) domain K+ channel, TREK-2 (KCNKA; KCNK10; K2P10). Activated by membrane stretch, acidic pH, arachidonic acid and unsaturated fatty acids.  Dong et al. 2015 described crystal structures of the human TREK-2 channel (up to 3.4 angstrom resolution) in two conformations and in complex with norfluoxetine, the active metabolite of fluoxetine (Prozac) and a state-dependent blocker of TREK channels. Norfluoxetine binds within intramembrane fenestrations found in only one of these two conformations. Channel activation by arachidonic acid and mechanical stretch involves conversion between these states through movement of the pore-lining helices. This provides an explanation for TREK channel mechanosensitivity, regulation by diverse stimuli, and possible off-target effects of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Prozac (Dong et al. 2015).  The unique gating properties of TREK-2 and the mechanisms by which extracellular and intracellular stimuli harness pore gating allosterically have been studied (Zhuo et al. 2016). TREK-2 moves from the """"down"""" to """"up"""" conformation in direct response to membrane stretch. Aryal et al. 2017 showed how state-dependent interactions with lipids affect the movement of TREK-2, and how stretch influences both the inner pore and selectivity filter. They also demonstrated why direct pore block by lipid tails does not represent theprincipal mechanism of mechanogating (Aryal et al. 2017). The M2-hinges of TREK-1 and TREK-2 channels control their macroscopic current, subcellular localization and gating (Zhuo et al. 2017). TREK-2 responds to a diverse range of stimuli. Two states, termed """"up"""" and """"down,"""" are known from x-ray structural crystallographic studies and have been suggested to differ in conductance. Brennecke and de Groot 2018 found that the down state is less conductive than the up state. The introduction of membrane stretch in the simulations shifts the state of the channel toward an up configuration. Membrane pressure changes the conformation of the transmembrane helices directly and consequently also influences the channel conductance (Brennecke and de Groot 2018). 3-d structures are known (PDB 4XDJ_!-D. Phosphatidyl-(3,5)-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) activates (Kirsch et al. 2018).

AMPA-selective glutamate ionotropic channel receptor (GIC; AMPAR), kainate-subtype, GluR-K1; GluR1; GluR-A; GluA1; Gria1 of 906 aas (preferentially monovalent cation selective). Contributes to amygdala-dependent emotional learning and fear conditioning (Humeau et al., 2007). Transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) gamma-7 (TC#8.A.16.2.5) selectively enhances the synaptic expression of Ca2+-permeable (CP-AMPARs) and suppresses calcium-impermeable (CI-AMPAR) activities (Studniarczyk et al. 2013).  Thus, TARPs modulate the pharmacology and gating of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Soto et al. 2014).  TARPs interact with the N-terminal domain of the AMPAR and control channel gating; residues in the receptor and the TARP involved in this interaction have been identified (Cais et al. 2014).  The auxilary protein, Shisa9 or CKAMP44 (UniProt acc# B4DS77), has a C-terminal PDZ domain that allows interaction with scaffolding proteins and AMPA glutamate receptors (Karataeva et al. 2014).  The transmembrane domain alone can tetramerize (Gan et al. 2016). The most potent and well-tolerated AMPA receptor inhibitors, used to treat epilepsy, act via a noncompetitive mechanism.  The crystal structures of the rat AMPA-subtype GluA2 receptor in complex with three noncompetitive inhibitors have been solved. The inhibitors bind to a binding site, completely conserved between rat and human, at the interface between the ion channel and linkers connecting it to the ligand-binding domains (Yelshanskaya et al. 2016). The endogenous neuropeptide, cyclopropylglycine, at a physiological concentration of 1 µM, enhances the transmembrane AMPA currents in rat cerebellar Purkinje cells (Gudasheva et al. 2016). The energetics of glutamate binding have been estimated (Yu and Lau 2017). The TMEM108 protein (Q6UXF1 of 575 aas and 2 TMSs, N- and C-terminal, is required for surface expression of AMPA receptors (Jiao et al. 2017). CERC-611 is a selective antagonist of AMPA receptors containing transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein (TARP; TC# 8.A.16) gamma-8 (Witkin et al. 2017).

GriK2; GluK2; GluR6 glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 2. The 3-d structure is known (2XXY_A). The domain organization and function have been analyzed by Das et al. (2010).  Two auxiliary subunits, Neto1 and Neto2 (Neuropilin and tolloid-like proteins) alter the trafficking, channel kinetics and pharmacology of the receptors (Howe 2014).  They reduce inward rectification without altering calcium permeability (Fisher and Mott 2012). Interactions between the pore helix (M2) and adjacent segments of the transmembrane inner (M3) and outer (M1) helices may be involved in gating (Lopez et al. 2013). Mutations in the human GRIK2 (GLUR6) cause moderate-to-severe nonsyndromic autosomal recessive mental retardation (Motazacker et al. 2007). Kainate receptors regulate KCC2 (TC# 1.A.10.1.11) expression in the hippocampus (Pressey et al. 2017). GluR6, carrying the pore loop plus adjacent transmembrane domains of the prokaryotic, glutamate-gated, K+-selective GluR0 (TC# 1.A.10.2.1), adopted several electrophysiological properties of the donor pore uponpore transplantation (Hoffmann et al. 2006).

The NMDA receptor. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domains (GluN1 and GluN2) have been determined (PDB#3QEL; Talukder and Wollmuth, 2011). The ligand-specific deactivation time courses of GluN1/GluN2D NMDA receptors have been measured (Vance et al., 2011).  NMDA receptors are Hebbian-like coincidence detectors, requiring binding of glycine and glutamate in combination with the relief of voltage-dependent magnesium block to open an ion conductive pore. Lee et al. 2014 presented X-ray structures of the Xenopus laevis GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor with the allosteric inhibitor, Ro25-6981, partial agonists and the ion channel blocker, MK-801. Receptor subunits are arranged in a 1-2-1-2 fashion, demonstrating extensive interactions between the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. The 3-TMS transmembrane domains harbour a closed-blocked ion channel, a pyramidal central vestibule lined by residues implicated in binding ion channel blockers and magnesium, and a approximately twofold symmetric arrangement of ion channel pore loops.

Glu2 AMPA receptor (GluR-2; GluR2-flop; CX614; GluA2).  The 3-d structure is known at 3.6 Å resolution.  It shows a 4-fold axis of symmetry in the transmembrane domain, and a 2-fold axis of symmetry overall, although it is a homotetramer (Sobolevsky et al. 2009). A structure showing an agoniar-bound form of the rat GluA2 receptor revealed conformational changes that occur during gating (Yelshanskaya et al. 2014). GluR2 interacts directly with ß3 integrin (Pozo et al., 2012).  In general, integrin receptors form macromolelcular complexes with ion channels (Becchetti et al. 2010).  TARPS are required for AMP receptor function and trafficking, but seven other auxiliary subunits have also been identified (Sumioka 2013). For example, AMPA receptors are regulated by S-SCAM through TARPs (Danielson et al. 2012).  The C-terminal domains of various TARPs (TC#8.A.16.2) play direct roles in the regulation of GluRs (Sager et al. 2011).  Whole-genome analyses have linked multiple TARP loci to childhood epilepsy, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (Kato et al. 2010). Thus, TARPs emerge as vital components of excitatory synapses that participate both in signal transduction and in neuropsychiatric disorders. The architecture of a fully occupied GluR2-TARP complex has been illucidated by cryoEM, showing the homomeric GluA2 AMPA receptor saturated with TARP ?2 subunits, showing how the TARPs are arranged with four-fold symmetry around the ion channel domain, making extensive interactions with the M1, M2 and M4 TMSs (Zhao et al. 2016).

Glutamate receptor 4, GIC, AMPA-subtype, GluR4, GRIA4 or GluR-D (preferentially monovalent cation selective). Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter, L-glutamate, induces a conformation change, leading to the opening of the cation channel, thereby converting the chemical signal to an electrical impulse. The receptor then desensitizes rapidly and enters a transient inactive state, characterized by the presence of bound agonist. In the presence of CACNG4, CACNG7 or CACNG8, GluR4 shows resensitization characterized by a delayed accumulation of current flux upon continued application of glutamate (Gill et al. 2008; Birdsey-Benson et al. 2010). De novo variants in GRIA4 lead to intellectual disability with or without seizures, gait abnormalities, problems of social behavior, and other variable features (Martin et al. 2017).

AMPA glutamate receptor 3 (GluR3) (non-selective monovalent cation channel and Ca2+  channel) (Ayalon et al., 2005; Midgett et al., 2012). Regulated by AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) including stargazin and CNIH auxiliary subunits (Kim et al., 2010; Straub and Tomita, 2011; Jackson and Nicoll, 2011; Bats et al., 2012; Rigby et al. 2015). The domain architecture of a calcium-permeable AMPA receptor in a ligand-free conformation has been solved (Midgett et al., 2012). The TARP, stargazin, is elevated in the somatosensory cortex of Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats (Kennard et al. 2011). TARPs alter the conformation of pore-forming subunits and thereby affect antagonist interactions (Cokic and Stein 2008).  The structural basis of AMPAR regulation by TARP gamma2, or stargazin (STZ) involves variable interaction stoichiometries of the AMPAR-TARP complex, with one or two TARP molecules binding one tetrameric AMPAR (Twomey et al. 2016).  The ion channel extracellular collar plays a role in gating and represents a hub for powerful allosteric modulation of AMPA receptor function (Yelshanskaya et al. 2017). The A653T mutation stabilizes the closed configuration of the channel and affects duration of sleep and awake periods in both humans and mice (Davies et al. 2017).

The homomeric cation channel/glutamate receptor/kainate 1, GluR5 (weakly responsive to glutamate) (expressed in the developing nervous system) (Bettler et al., 1990).  The 3-d structures of the protein have been determined with agonists and antagonists.  The agonist, domoic acid, stabilizes the ligand-binding core of the iGluR5 complex in a conformation that is 11 degrees more open than the conformation observed when the full agonist, (S)-glutamate, is bound (Hald et al. 2007). Kainate receptors regulate KCC2 expression in the hippocampus (Pressey et al. 2017).

The heteromeric monovalent cation/Ca2+ channel/glutamate (NMDA) receptor NMDAR1/NMDAR2A/NMDAR2B/NMDAR2C) (Monyer et al., 1992). Note: NR2B is the same as NR3, GluN2A, GRIN2A or subunit epsilon (Schüler et al., 2008). Mediates voltage- and Mg2+-dependent control of Na+ and Ca2+ permeability (Yang et al., 2010).  Mutations in the subunit, GRIN1, a 1464 aa protein, identified in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and profound developmental delay, are located in the transmembrane domain and the linker region between the ligand-binding and transmembrane domains (Yuan et al. 2014; Ohba et al. 2015).  Karakas and Furukawa 2014 determined the crystal structure of the heterotetrameric GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor ion channel at 4 Å resolution. The receptor is arranged as a dimer of GluN1-GluN2B heterodimers with the twofold symmetry axis running through the entire molecule composed of an amino terminal domain, a ligand-binding domain, and a transmembrane domain.  The GluN2 subunit regulates synaptic trafficking of AMPA in the neonatal mouse brain (Hamada et al. 2014).  GRIN1 and GRIN2A mutations are associated with severe intellectual disability with cortical visual impairment, epilepsy and oculomotor and movement disorders being discriminating phenotypic features (Lemke et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2017).The cryoEM structure of a triheteromeric receptor including GluN1 (glycine binding), GluN2A and GluN2B (both glutamate binding)has been solved with and without a GluN2B the allosteric antagonist, Ro 25-6981 (Lü et al. 2017). Ogden et al. 2017 implicated the pre-M1 region in gating, provided insight into how different subunits contribute to gating, and suggested that mutations in the pre-M1 helix, such as those that cause epilepsy and developmental delays, can compromise neuronal health.

(2009) have described characteristics of the pore/vestibule. The structure is known to 2.1 Å resolution (Gruswitz et al., 2010). Each monomer contains 12 transmembrane helices, one more than in the bacterial homologs. Reconstituted into proteoliposomes, RhCG conducts NH3 to raise the internal pH. Models of the erythrocyte Rh complex based on the RhCG structure suggest that the erythrocytic Rh complex is composed of stochastically assembled heterotrimers of RhAG, RhD, and RhCE (Gruswitz et al., 2010).

Nuclear chloride channel-27, NCC27 or CLIC1 (Br- > Cl- > I-) (241 aas).  CLIC1 has two charged residues, K37 and R29, in its single TMS which are important for the biophysical properties of the channel (Averaimo et al. 2013).  A putative Lys37-Trp35 cation-pi interaction stabilizes the active dimeric form of the CLIC1 TMS in membranes (Peter et al. 2013).  This channel may play a role in cancer (Peretti et al. 2014).  A positively charged motif at the C-terminus of the single TMS enhances membrane partitioning and insertion via electrostatic contacts.  It also functions as an electrostatic plug to anchor the TMS in membranes and is involved in orientating the TMS with respect to the cis and trans faces of the membrane (Peter et al. 2014).

Formate uptake/efflux permease, FocA.  It catalyzes bidirectional transport, has a pentameric aquaporin-like (TC# 1.A.8) structure, and may function by a channel-type mechanism (Falke et al., 2009; Wang et al. 2009). The structure at 2.25 Å resolution has been determined (Wang et al., 2009).  The protein is encoded in an operon with pyruvate-formate lyase, PflB.  A pyruvate:formate antiport mechanism has been suggested (Moraes and Reithmeier 2012). The C-terminal 6 aas are required for formate transport, but not for homopentamer formation (Hunger et al. 2017).  The N-terminus of FocA interacts with PflB, and this interaction is essential for optimal formate translocation (Doberenz et al. 2014). In fact, the GREs, TdcE and PflB, interact with the FNT channel protein, probably to control formate translocation by FocA (Falke et al. 2016).

TMEM16 of 735 aas and 10 TMSs.  Operates as a Ca2+-activated lipid scramblase (Wang et al. 2018). Each subunit of the homodimer contains a hydrophilic membrane-traversing cavity that is exposed to the lipid bilayer as a potential site of catalysis. This cavity harbours a conserved Ca2+-binding site, located within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Mutations of residues involved in Ca2+ coordination affect both lipid scrambling in N. haematococca TMEM16 and ion conduction in the Cl- channel of TMEM16A. The structure reveals the general architecture of the family and its mode of Ca2+ activation (Brunner et al. 2014). While the cytoplasmic portion of the protein is important for function, it does not appear to regulate scramblase activity via a detectable conformational change (Andra et al. 2018).

Tic110 channel protein. The x-ray structure (4.2Å resolution) of Tic110B and C from Cyanidioschyzon merolae is known (Tsai et al., 2013). The C-terminal half of Tic110 posesses a rod-shaped helix-repeat structure that is too flattened and elongated to be a channel. The structure is most similar to the HEAT-repeat motif that functions as scaffolds for protein-protein interactions (Tsai et al., 2013).

Matrix protein, M2, an acid activated drug-sensitive proton channel.  Transport involves binding to the four His-37s and transfer to water molecules on the inside of the channel (Acharya et al., 2010).  Functional properties and structure are known (Hong and Degrado 2012). The cytoplasmic tail facilitates proton conduction (Liao et al. 2015).  It is a dimer of dimers (Andreas et al. 2015).  The four TMSs flanking the channel lumen alone seem to determine the proton conduction mechanism (Liang et al. 2016). His-37 forms a planar tetrad in the configuration of the bundle accepting and translocating the incoming protons from the N terminal side, exterior of the virus, to the C terminal side, inside the virus (Kalita and Fischer 2017). The cholesterol binding site in M2 that mediates membrane scission in a cholesterol-dependent manner to cause virus budding and release has been identified (Elkins et al. 2017).Transport-related conformational changes coupled to water and H+ movements have been studied (Mandala et al. 2018).

Chen et al. 2017 found that the G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel is activated by  Ivermectin (IVM) directly.

The mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing channel-forming protein, BAX.  The C-terminal helix mediates membrane binding and pore formation (Garg et al. 2012). BAX pores are large enough to allow cytochrome c release and it activates the mitochondrial permeabilty transition pore; both play a role in programmed cell death, but the latter is quantitatively more important (Gómez-Crisóstomo et al. 2013). Bax functions like a holin when expressed in bacteria (Pang et al. 2011).  Bax (and likely Bak) dimers assemble into oligomers with an even number of molecules that fully or partially delineate pores of different sizes to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) during apoptosis (Cosentino and García-Sáez 2016). The membrane domain of Bax interacts with other members of the Bcl-2 family to form hetero-oligomers (Andreu-Fernández et al. 2017).  Uren et al. 2017 reviewed how clusters of dimers and their lipid-mediated interactions provide a molecular explanation for the heterogeneous assemblies of Bak and Bax observed during apoptosis. After BAK/BAX activation and cytochrome c loss, the mitochondrial network breaks down, and large BAK/BAX pores appear in the outer membrane. These macropores allow the inner membrane an outlet through which it herniated, carrying with it mitochondrial matrix components including the mitochondrial genome (McArthur et al. 2018). The core/dimerization domain of Bax and Bak is water exposed with only helices 4 and 5 in membrane contact, whereas the piercing/latch domain is in peripheral membrane contact, with helix 9 being transmembrane (Bleicken et al. 2018).

The mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing channel-forming protein, BAK. 3-D structures are known (2IMT_A).  Functions like a holin when expressed in bacteria (Pang et al. 2011).  Formation of the apoptotic pore involves a flexible C-terminal domain (Iyer et al. 2015). Bax (and likely Bak) dimers assemble into oligomers with an even number of molecules that fully or partially delineate pores of different sizes to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) during apoptosis (Cosentino and García-Sáez 2016). BAK is a C-tail-anchored mitochondrial outer membrane protein (Setoguchi et al. 2006). BAK plays a role in peroxisomal permeability, similar to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (Hosoi et al. 2017).  Uren et al. 2017 reviewed how clusters of dimers and their lipid-mediated interactions provide a molecular explanation for the heterogeneous assemblies of Bak and Bax observed during apoptosis.  After BAK/BAX activation and cytochrome c loss, the mitochondrial network breaks down, and large BAK/BAX pores appear in the outer membrane.

Large mechanosensitive ion channel: MscL; catalyzes efflux of ions (slightly cation selective), osmolytes and small proteins. Protein-lipid interactions are important for gating, dependent on TMS tilting (Iscla et al., 2011b).  The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic helices assemble into a pentameric bundle that resembles cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and these are required for the selective formation of the pentamer (Ando et al. 2015). Lysophospholipids can increase the size of particles that can be transported (Foo et al. 2015). 500 - 700 channels are needed for 80% survival, a number of channels similar to that found in cell (Chure et al. 2018). its activation threshold decreases with membrane thickness; the membrane-thickness-dependent MscL opening mainly arises from structural changes in MscL to match the altered membrane thickness by stretching (Katsuta et al. 2018).

Large conductance mechanosensitive channel protein, MscL, of 101 aas and 2 TMSs. When the membrane is stretched, MscL responds to the increase of membrane tension and opens a nonselective pore to about 30 A wide, exhibiting a large unitary conductance of approximately 3 nS. The structures of this archaeal MscL, trapped in the closed and expanded intermediate states, has been solved (Li et al. 2015). The comparative analysis of these two new structures reveals significant conformational rearrangements in the different domains of MscL. The large changes observed in the tilt angles of the two transmembrane helices (TMS1 and TMS2) fit well with the helix-pivoting model. Meanwhile, the periplasmic loop region transforms from a folded structure, containing an omega-shaped loop and a short beta-hairpin, to an extended and partly disordered conformation during channel expansion. Moreover, a significant rotating and sliding of the N-terminal helix (N-helix) is coupled to the tilting movements of TMS1 and TMS2. The dynamic relationships between the N-helix and TMS1/TMS2 suggest that the N-helix serves as a membrane-anchored stopper that limits the tilts of TM1 and TM2 in the gating process (Li et al. 2015).

Major MscS channel protein, YggB. Seven residues, mostly hydrophobic, in the first and second transmembrane helices are lipid-sensing residues (Malcolm et al., 2011).  X-ray structures are available (Lai et al. 2013).  The cytoplasmic cage domain senses macromolecular crowding (Rowe et al. 2014). A gating mechanism has been proposed (Malcolm et al. 2015).  The thermodynamics of K+ leak have been studied (Koprowski et al. 2015).  In the MscS crystal structure (PDB 2OAU ), a narrow, hydrophobic opening is visible in the crystal structure, and a vapor lock, created by hydrophobic seals consisting of L105 and L109, is the barrier to water and ions (Rasmussen et al. 2015). The voltage dependence of inactivation occurs independently of the positive charges of R46, R54, and R74 (Nomura et al. 2016).

Connexin 43 (gap junction a-1 protein), CX43 (transports ATP, ADP and AMP better than CX32 does; Goldberg et al., 2002). Hemichannels mediate efflux of glutathione, glutamate and other amino acids as well as ATP (Stridh et al., 2008; Kang et al., 2008). CX43 has a half life of ~3 h due to ubiquitination and lysosomal and proteasomal degradation (Leithe and Rivedal, 2007). Cx43 and Cx46 regulate each other's expression and turnover in a reciprocal manner in addition to their conventional roles as gap junction proteins in lens cells (Banerjee et al., 2011). A mutant form of Connexin 43 causes Oculodentodigital dysplasia (Gabriel et al., 2011).  Suppressing the function of Cx43 promotes expression of wound healing-associated genes and hibitits scarring (Tarzemany et al. 2015).  Channel conductance and size selectivity are largely determined by pore diameter, whereas charge selectivity results from the amino-terminal domains; transitions between fully open and (multiple) closed states involves global changes in structure of the pore-forming domains (Ek Vitorín et al. 2016). The human Cx43 orthologue is almost identical to the rat protein.  It may mediate resistance against the parkinsonian toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+) which induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells by modulating mitochondrial apoptosis (Kim et al. 2016).  Dopamine neurons may be the target of MPP+ and play a role in Parkinson's disease. In humans, Cx43 plays roles in the development of the central nervous system and in the progression of glioma (Wang et al. 2017).  It interacts with and is regulated by many proteins including NOV (CCN3, IGFBP9; P48745) (Giepmans 2006). Cx43 plays roles in intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vesicles, tunnelling nanotubes and gap junctions (Ribeiro-Rodrigues et al. 2017). Phosphorylation of Cx43 leads to astrocytic coupling and apoptosis, and ultimately, to vascular regeneration in retinal ischemia (Slavi et al. 2018).

Heteromeric connexin (Cx)32/Cx26) (transports cAMP, cGMP and all inositol phosphates with 1-4 esterified phosphate groups (homomeric Cx26(ß2) or homomeric Cx32 do not transport the inositol phosphates as well) (Ayad et al., 2006). The GJB2 gene encodes connexin 26, the protein involved in cell-cell attachment in many tissues. GJB2 mutations cause autosomal recessive (DFNB1) and sometimes dominant (DFNA3) non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss as well as various skin disease phenotypes (Iossa et al., 2011). TMS1 regulates oligomerization and function (Jara et al., 2012).  The carboxyl tail pg Cx32 regulates gap junction assembly (Katoch et al. 2015).  In Cx46, neutralization of negative charges or addition of positive charge in the Cx26 equivalent region reduced the slow gate voltage dependence. In Cx50 the addition of a glutamate in the same region decreased the voltage dependence and the neutralization of a negative charge increased it. Thus, the charges at the end of TMS1 are part of the slow gate voltage sensor in Cxs. The fact that Cx42, which has no charge in this region, still presents voltage dependent slow gating suggests that charges still unidentified also contribute to the slow gate voltage sensitivity (Pinto et al. 2016).  Syndromic deafness mutations at Asn14 alter the open stability of Cx26 hemichannels (Sanchez et al. 2016). The Leu89Pro substitution in the second TMS of CX32 disrupts the trafficking of the protein, inhibiting the assembly of CX32 gap junctions, which in turn may result in peripheral neuropathy (Da et al. 2016).  Cx26 mutants that promote cell death or exert transdominant effects on other connexins in keratinocytes lead to skin diseases and hearing loss, whereas mutants having reduced channel function without aberrant effects on coexpressed connexins cause only hearing loss (Press et al. 2017). When challenged by a field of 0.06 V/nm, the Cx26 hemichannel relaxed toward a novel configuration characterized by a widened pore and an increased bending of the second TMS at the level of the conserved Pro87. A point mutation that inhibited such a transition impeded hemichannel opening in electrophysiology and dye uptake experiments.  Thus, the Cx26 hemichannel uses a global degree of freedom to transit between different configuration states, which may be shared among all connexins (Zonta et al. 2018).

KB for urea is ~150mM (Sachs et al., 2006; Scott et al., 2010). Transport kinetics and selectivity have been defined (Gray et al., 2011).  The 3-d structure reveals a hexameric protein with a channel included within the twisted 6 TMS bundle of each protomer.  It displays a two helix hairpin structure repeated three times around the central axis of the channel (Strugatsky et al. 2012).

Ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel, RyR2.  Causes Ca2+ release from the E.R. and consequent cardiac arrhythmia (Chelu and Wehrens, 2007). Associates with FKBP12.6, but phosphorylation by protein kinase A on serine-2030 causes dissociation (Jones et al., 2008).  Enhanced binding of calmodulin corrects arrhythmogenic channel disorder in myocytes (Fukuda et al. 2014).  RyR2s can open spontaneously, giving rise to spatially-confined Ca2+ release events known as "sparks." They are organized in a lattice to form clusters in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The spatial arrangement of RyR2s within clusters strongly influences the frequency of Ca2+ sparks (Walker et al. 2015).  Structures of RyR2 from porcine heart in both the open and closed states at near atomic resolutions have been determined using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (Peng et al. 2016). Structural comparisons revealed breathing motions of the overall cytoplasmic region resulting from the interdomain movements of amino-terminal domains (NTDs), Helical domains, and Handle domains, whereas little intradomain shifts are observed in these armadillo repeat-containing domains. Outward rotations of the central domains, which integrate the conformational changes of the cytoplasmic region, lead to the dilation of the cytoplasmic gate through coupled motions. These observations provide insight into the gating mechanism of RyRs (Peng et al. 2016). RyR2 is subject ot regulation by cytoplasmic Zn2+ (>1nM), and this regulation plays a key role in diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage in cardiac muscle (Reilly-O'Donnell et al. 2017). Ryanodine receptor-mediated SR Ca2+ efflux is apparently balanced by concomitant counterion currents across the SR membrane (Sanchez et al. 2018).

The Ryanodine receptor Ca2+/K+ release tetrameric channel, RyR1, present in skeletal muscle, is 5038 aas long. Mutants are linked to core myopathies such as Central Core Disease, Malignant Hyperthermia and Multiple Minicore Disease) (Xu et al., 2008). RyR1 interacts with CLIC2 to modulate its channel activity (Meng et al., 2009).  A model pf RyR1 has been constructed encompassing the six transmembrane helices to calculate the RyR1 pore region conductance, to analyze its structural stability, and to hypothesize the mechanism of the Ile4897 CCD-associated mutation. The calculated conductance of the wild-type RyR1 suggests that the pore structure can sustain ion currents measured in single-channel experiments. Shirvanyants et al. 2014 observed a stable pore structure with multiple cations occupying the selectivity filter and cytosolic vestibule, but not the inner chamber. Stability of the selectivity filter depends on interactions between the I4897 residue and several hydrophobic residues of the neighboring subunit. Loss of these interactions in the case of the polar substitution, I4897T, results in destabilization of the selectivity filter, a possible cause of the CCD-specific reduced Ca2+ conductance.  A 4.8 Å structure of the rabbit orthologue in the closed state of this 2.3 MDa tetramer (3757 aas/protomer) reveals the pore, the VIC superfamily fold and a potential mechanism of Ca2+ gating (Zalk et al. 2015).  A cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed the structure at 6.1 Å resolution (Efremov et al. 2015). The transmembrane domain represents a chimaera of voltage-gated sodium and pH-activated ion channels. They identified the calcium-binding EF-hand domain and showed that it functions as a conformational switch, allosterically gating the channel.  Malignant hyperthermia-associated RyR1 mutations in the S2-S3 loop confer RyR2-type Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent channel regulation (Gomez et al. 2016).  Structural analyses have elucidated a novel channel-gating mechanism and a novel ion selectivity mechanism for RyR1 (Wei et al. 2016).  Samsó 2016 reviewed structural determinations of RyR by cryoEM and  analyzed the first near-atomic structures, revealing a complex orchestration of domains controlling channel function.  The structural basis for gating and activation have been determined (des Georges et al. 2016). Junctin and triadin bind to different sites on RyR1; triadin plays an important role in ensuring rapid Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.  RyR1 structure/functioin has been reviewed (Zalk and Marks 2017). Possibly, luminal Ca2+ activates RyR1 by accessing a cytosolic Ca2+ binding site in the open channel as the Ca2+ ions pass through the pore (Xu et al. 2017).

Annexxin of 369 aas.  Schistosomiasis, a major parasitic disease of humans, is second only to malaria in its global impact. The disease is caused by digenean trematodes that infest the vasculature of their human hosts. These flukes are limited externally by a body wall composed of a syncytial epithelium, the apical surface membrane, a parasitism-adapted dual membrane complex. Annexins are important for the stability of this apical membrane system. Leow et al. 2013 presented the first structural and immunobiochemical characterization of an annexin from Schistosoma mansoni. The crystal structures of annexin B22 (4MDV and 4MDU) in the apo and Ca2+ bound forms confirmed the presence of the previously predicted a-helical segment in the II/III linker and revealed a covalently linked head-to-head dimer. The dimeric arrangement revealed a non-canonical membrane binding site and a probable binding groove opposite the binding site. Annexin B22 expression correlated with life stages of the parasite that possess the syncytial tegument layer, and ultrastructural localization by immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the occurrence of annexins in the tegument of S. mansoni.

Magnesium transport protein, CorA.  The structure at 2.7 Å resolution is known. The CorA monomer has a C-terminal membrane domain containing two transmembrane segments and a large N-terminal cytoplasmic soluble domain. In the membrane, CorA forms a homopentamer shaped like a funnel which binds fully hydrated Mg2+ in the periplasm (Maguire 2006). A ring of positive charges are external to the ion-conduction pathway at the cytosolic membrane interface, and highly negatively charged helices in the cytosolic domain  appear to interact with the ring of positive charge to facilitate Mg2+ entry. Mg2+ ions are present in the cytosolic domain that are well placed to control the interaction of the ring of positive charge and the negatively charged helices, and thus, control Mg2+ entry (Maguire 2006).  Gating is achieved by helical rotation upon the binding of a metal ion substrate to the regulatory binding sites. The preference for Co2+ over Mg2+ has been reported to be determined by the presence of threonine side chains in the channel (Nordin et al. 2013), but more recently, Kowatz and Maguire 2018 showed that Co2+ is not a substrate, and that the intersubunit bound Mg2+ is not required for function and does not control the open versus closed states.

Zn2+/Cd2+ efflux system, ZntB. Mg2+ is not transported. Wan et al. 2011 reported crystal structures in dimeric and physiologically relevant homopentameric forms at 2.3 Å and 3.1 Å resolutions, respectively. The funnel-like structure is similar to that of the homologous Thermotoga maritima CorA Mg2+ channel and a Vibrio parahaemolyticus ZntB (VpZntB). However, the central a7 helix forming the inner wall of the StZntB funnel is oriented perpendicular to the membrane instead of the marked angle seen in CorA or VpZntB. Consequently, the StZntB funnel pore is cylindrical, not tapered, which may represent an "open" form of the ZntB soluble domain. There are three Zn2+ binding sites in the full-length ZntB, two of which could be involved in Zn2+ transport.

Mitochondrial inner membrane Mg2+ channel protein, Mrs2 (Schindl et al., 2007).

Vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1 or TRPV1) (noxious, heat-sensitive [opens with increasing temperatures; e.g., >42°C]; also sensitive to acidic pH and voltage and inflamation; serves as the receptor for the alkaloid irritant, capsaicin, for resiniferatoxin and for endo-cannabinoids (Murillo-Rodriguez et al. 2017). It is regulated by bradykinin and prostaglandin E2) (contains a C-terminal region, adjacent to the channel gate, that determines the coupling of stimulus sensing and channel opening (Garcia-Sanz et al., 2007; Matta and Ahern, 2007). Activated and sensitized by local anesthetics in sensory neurons (Leffler et al., 2008). A bivalent tarantula toxin activates the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) by targeting the outer pore domain (Bohlen et al., 2010). Single-channel properties of TRPV1 are modulated by phosphorylation (Studer and McNaughton, 2010). TRPV1 mediates an itch associated response (Kim et al., 2011). The thermosensitive TRP channel pore turret is part of the temperature activation apparatus (Yang et al., 2010). Modular thermal sensors in temperature-gated transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been identified (Yao et al., 2011). TRPV1 opening is associated with major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism (Cao et al. 2013). Allosteric coupling between upper and lower gates may account for modulation exhibited by TRPV1 and other TRP channels (Liao et al. 2013).  Regulates longevity and metabolism by neuropeptides in mice (Riera et al. 2014). The pore of TRPV1 contains the structural elements sufficient for activation by noxious heat (Zhang et al. 2017).

The noxious heat (>52°C)-sensitive vanilloid-like receptor cation selective channel, TRPV2. Ca2+-dependent desensitization of TRPV2 channels is mediated by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Mercado et al., 2010).  Deleting the first N-terminal 74 residues preceding the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) shows a key role for this region in targeting the protein to the membrane. Co-translational insertion of the membrane-embedded region occurs with the TM1-TM4 and TM5-TM6 regions assembling as independent folding domains. ARD is not required for TM domain insertion into the membrane (Doñate-Macian et al. 2015).  The TRPV2 structure has been solved at 4 Å resolution by cryoEM (Zubcevic et al. 2016).

The nociceptive neuron TRPA1 (Trp-ankyrin 1) senses peripheral damage by transmitting pain signals (activated by cold temperatures, pungent compounds and environmental irritants). Noxious compounds also activate through covalent modification of cysteyl residues (Macpherson et al., 2007). TRPA1 is an excitatory, nonselective cation channel implicated in somatosensory function, pain, and neurogenic inflammation. Through covalent modification of cysteine and lysine residues, TRPA1 can be activated by electrophilic compounds, including active ingredients of pungent natural products (e.g., allyl isothiocyanate), environmental irritants (e.g., acrolein), and endogenous ligands (4-hydroxynonenal) (Chen et al., 2008). General anesthetics activate TRPA1 nociceptive ion channels to enhance pain and inflammation (Matta et al., 2008; Leffler et al., 2011). TMS5 is a critical molecular determinant of menthol sensitivity (Xiao et al., 2008). TRPA1 is a component of the nociceptive response to CO2 (Wang et al., 2010). TRPA1 is a polyunsaturated fatty acid sensor in mammals but not in flies and fish (Motter and Ahern, 2012). It  is regulated by its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (Zayats et al., 2012).  Mutations in TrpA1 cause alterred pain perception (Kremeyer et al. 2010). The hop compound, eudesmol, an oxygenated sesquiterpene, activates the channel (Ohara et al. 2015).  These channels regulate heat and cold perception, mechanosensitivity, hearing, inflammation, pain, circadian rhythms, chemoreception, and other processes (Laursen et al. 2014).  TRPA1 is a polymodal ion channel sensitive to temperature and chemical stimuli, but its resposes are species specific (Laursen et al. 2015). A probable binding site for general anesthetics has been identified (Ton et al. 2017), and specific residues involved in binding of the anesthetic, propofol, are known (Woll et al. 2017).

Polycystin 1 (PKD1 or PC1) assembles with TRPP2 (Q86VP3) in a stoichiometry of 3TRPP2: 1PKD1, forming the receptor/ion channel complex (Yu et al., 2009). The C-terminal coiled-coil complex is critical for proper assembly (Zhu et al., 2011).  Missense mutations have been identified that affect membrane topogenesis (Nims et al. 2011). Biomarkers for polycystic kidney diseases have been identified (Hogan et al. 2015).  Extracellular divalent ions, including Ca2+, inhibit permeation of monovalent ions by directly blocking the TRPP2 channel pore. D643, a negatively charged amino acid in the pore, is crucial for channel permeability (Arif Pavel et al. 2016). Polycystin (TRPP/PKD) complexes, made of transient receptor potential channel polycystin (TRPP)4 and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) proteins, play key roles in coupling extracellular stimuli with intracellular Ca2+ signals. PKD1 and PKD2 form a complex, the structure of which has been solved in 3-dimensions at high resolution.  The complex consists of PKD1:PKD2 = 3:1. PKD1 consists of a voltage-gated ion channel fold that interacts with PKD2 to complete a domain-swapped TRP architecture with unique features (Su et al. 2018; Su et al. 2018). The C-terminal tail of PKD1 may play a role in the prognosis of renal disease (Higashihara et al. 2018).

PKD2L1 is probably orthologous to mouse TC# 1.A.5.2.2. The voltage dependence of PKD2L1 may reflect the charge state of the S4 domain (Numata et al. 2017). PKD2L1, (TRPP3) is involved in the sour sensation and other pH-dependent processes and is a nonselective cation channel that can be regulated by voltage, protons, and calcium. The 3-d structure has been determined by cryoEM at 3.4 Å resolution (Su et al. 2018). Unlike its ortholog PKD2, the pore helix and TMS6, which are involved in upper and lower-gate opening, adopt an open conformation. The pore domain dilation is coupled to conformational changes of voltage-sensing domains via a series of pi-pi interactions, suggesting a potential PKD2L1 gating mechanism (Su et al. 2018).

Polycystin 2 (PKD2, PC2 or TRPP2) of 968 aas and 8 TMSs (Anyatonwu and Ehrlich, 2005). Regulated by a-actinin (AAC17470) by direct binding (Li et al., 2007). Regulated also by diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1) (Bai et al., 2008). Has 8 TMSs with 6 TMSs in the channel domain with N- and C- termini inside (Hoffmeister et al., 2010).  PC2 interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) to modulate Ca2+ signaling (Li et al. 2009). The PKD2 voltage- sensor domain retains two of four gating charges commonly found in voltage-gated ion channels. The PKD2 ion permeation pathway is constricted at the selectivity filter near the cytoplasmic end of S6, suggesting that two gates regulate ion conduction (Shen et al. 2016). 15% of cases of polycystic kidney disease are in this protein, while 85% are in PKD1 (Ghata and Cowley 2017). Topological changes between the closed and open sub-conductance states of the functional channel are observed with an inverse correlation between conductance and height of the channel. Unexpectedly, we also disclosed intrinsic PC2 mechanosensitivity in response to external forces was also observed (Lal et al. 2018).

Phospholamban (PLB) pentameric Ca2+/K+ channel (Kovacs et al., 1988; Smeazzetto et al. 2013; Smeazzetto et al. 2014).  In spite of extensive experimental evidence, suggesting a pore size of 2.2 Å, the conclusion of ion channel activity for phospholamban has been questioned (Maffeo and Aksimentiev 2009).  Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). This cyclic mechanism constitutes the driving force for calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm into the myocite lumen, regulating cardiac contractility. PLN undergoes a conformational transition between a relaxed (R) and tense (T) state, an equilibrium perturbed by the addition of SERCA. Phosphoryl transfer to Ser16 induces a conformational switch to the R state. The binding affinity of PLN to SERCA is not affected ((Kd ~ 60 microM). However, the binding surface and dynamics in domain Ib (residues 22-31) change substantially upon phosphorylation. Since PLN can be singly or doubly phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17, these sites may remotely control the conformation of domain Ib (Traaseth et al. 2006).

Sarcolipin (SLN). Oligomeric interactions of sarcolipin and the Ca-ATPase have been documented (Autry et al., 2011).  Sarcolipin, but not phospholamban, promotes uncoupling of the SERCA pump (3.A.3.2.7; Sahoo et al. 2013).  Forms a pentameric pore that can transport water, Na+, Ca2+ and Cl-.  Leu21 serves as the gate (Cao et al. 2015).   In the channel, water molecules near the Leu21 pore demonstrated a clear hydrated-dehydrated transition (Cao et al. 2016). Small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1; TC#8.A.28.1.2) and SLN interact with each other in their transmembrane domains to regulate SERCA (TC# 3.A.3.2.7) (Desmond et al. 2017).

The voltage-gated proton channel, mVSOP (269 aas and 2 TMSs) (Sasaki et al., 2006).  A hydrophobic plug functions as the gate (Chamberlin et al. 2013). Gating currents reveal that voltage-sensor (VS) activation and proton-selective aqueous conductance opening are thermodynamically distinct steps in the Hv1 activation pathway and show that pH changes directly alter VS activation. Gating cooperativity, pH-dependent modulation, and a high degree of H+ selectivity have been demonstrated (De La Rosa and Ramsey 2018).

The voltage-gated proton channel, Hv1, Hv1 or HVCN1 (273 aas) (Ramsey et al., 2006). Thr29 is a phosphorylation site that activates the HVCN1 channel in leukocytes (Musset et al., 2010). The condctivity pore has been delineated and depends of a carboxyl group (Asp or Glu) in the channel (Morgan et al. 2013). The four transmembrane helices sense voltage and the pH gradient, and conduct protons exclusively. Selectivity is achieved by the unique ability of H3O+ to protonate an Asp-Arg salt bridge. Pathognomonic sensitivity of gating to the pH gradient ensures HV1 channel opening only when acid extrusion will result, which is crucial to its biological functions (DeCoursey 2015). An exception occurs in dinoflagellates (see 1.A.51.1.4) in which H+ influx through HV1 triggers a bioluminescent flash. The gating mechanism of Hv1, cooperativity within dimers and the sensitivity to metal ions have been reviewed (Okamura et al. 2015). How this channel is activated by cytoplasmic [H+] and depolarization of the membrane potential has been proposed by Castillo et al. 2015. The extracellular ends of the first transmembrane segments form the intersubunit interface that mediates coupling between binding sites, while the coiled-coil domain does not directly participate in the process (Hong et al. 2015). Deep water penetration through hHv1 has been observed, suggesting a highly focused electric field, comprising two helical turns along the fourth TMS. This region likely contains the H+ selectivity filter and the conduction pore. A 3D model offers an explicit mechanism for voltage activation based on a one-click sliding helix conformational rearrangement (Li et al. 2015).  Trp-207 enables four characteristic properties: slow channel opening, highly temperature-dependent gating kinetics, proton selectivity, and ?pH-dependent gating (Cherny et al. 2015).  The native Hv structure is a homodimer, with the two channel subunits functioning cooperatively (Okuda et al. 2016).  Segment S3 plays a role in activating gating (Sakata et al. 2016).  Two sites have been identified: one is the binding pocket of 2GBI (accessible to ligands from the intracellular side); the other is located at the exit site of the proton permeation pathway (Gianti et al. 2016).   Crystal structures of Hv1 dimeric channels revealed that the primary contacts between the two monomers are in the C-terminal domain (CTD), which forms a coiled-coil structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of full-length and truncated CTD models revealed a strong contribution of the CTD to the packing of the TMSs (Boonamnaj and Sompornpisut 2018).  Histidine-168 is essential for the ?pH-dependent gating (Cherny et al. 2018).

The CRAC channel protein, Orai1 (CRACM1) (Prakriya et al. 2006), complexed with the STIM1 or STIM2 protein (Feske et al., 2006). Replacement of the conserved glutamate in the first TMS  with glutamine (E106Q) acts as a dominant-negative protein, and substitution with aspartate (E106D) enhances Na+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ permeation relative to Ca2+. Mutating E190Q in TMS3 also affects channel selectivity, suggesting that glutamate residues in both TMS1 and TMS3 face the lumen of the pore (Vig et al. 2006). The Orai1:Stim stoichiometry = 4:2 (Ji et al., 2008). Human Orai1 and Orai3 channels are dimeric in the closed resting state and open states. They are tetrameric when complexed with STIM1 (Demuro et al., 2011). A dimeric form catalyzes nonselective cation conductance in the STIM1-independent mode.  STIM1 domains have been characterized (How et al. 2013). Alternative translation initiation of the Orai1 message produces long and short types of Ca2+ channels with distinct signaling and regulatory properties (Desai et al. 2015).  STIM2 plays roles similar to STIM1 in regulating basal cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentrations by controling Orai1, 2 and 3.  STIM2 may inhibit STIM1-mediated Ca2+ influx.  It also regulates protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation and trafficking of AMPA receptors (TC# 1.A.10) (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2015). A mechanistic model for ROS (H2O2)-mediated inhibition of Orai1 has been determined (Alansary et al. 2016). Regions that are important for the optimal assembly of hetero-oligomers composed of full-length STIM1 with its minimal STIM1-ORAI activating region, SOAR, have been identified (Ma et al. 2017). Orai1 may be multifunctional (Carrell et al. 2016). Activatioin of Orai1 requires communication between the N-terminus and loop 2 (Fahrner et al. 2017). STIM1 dimers unfold to expose a discrete STIM-Orai activating region (SOAR1) that tethers and activates Orai1 channels within discrete ER-PM junctions (Zhou et al. 2018). SOAR dimer cross-linking leads to substantial Orai1 channel clustering, resulting in increased efficacy and cooperativity of Orai1 channel function. In addition to being an ER Ca2+ sensor, STIM1 functions within the PM to exert control over the operation of SOCs. As a cell surface signaling protein, STIM1 represents a key pharmacological target to control fundamental Ca2+-regulated processes including secretion, contraction, metabolism, cell division, and apoptosis (Spassova et al. 2006). STIM1 also contributes to smooth muscle contractility (Feldman et al. 2017). STIM1-mediated Orai1 channel gating, involves bridges between TMS 1 and the surrounding TMSs 2/3 ring, and these are critical for conveying the gating signal to the pore (Yeung et al. 2018). A review article summarizes the current high resolution structural data on specific EF-hand, sterile alpha motif and coiled-coil interactions which drive STIM function in the activation of Orai1 channels (Novello et al. 2018). Orai1 and STIM1 are involved in tubular aggregate myopathy (Wu et al. 2018). Knowledge of the structure-function relationships of CRAC channels, with a focus on key structural elements that mediate the STIM1 conformational switch and the dynamic coupling between STIM1 and ORAI1 has been discussed (Nguyen et al. 2018). While STIM1 is the native channel opener, a chemical modulator is 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (Ali et al. 2017).

Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel subunit, Orai, which mediates Ca2+ influx following depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores.  In Greek mythology, the 'Orai' are the keepers of the gates of heaven.  The crystal structure (3.35 Å), revealed a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore which traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs from those of other solved ion channels (Hou et al. 2012). Residues in the third TMS of orai affect the conduction properties of the channel (Alavizargar et al. 2018); a conserved glutamate residue (E262) contributes to selectivity. Mutation of this residue affected the hydration pattern of the pore domain, and impaired selectivity of Ca2+ over Na+. The crevices of water molecules are located to contribute to the dynamics of the hydrophobic gate and the basic gate, suggesting a possible role in channel opening and in selectivity function (Alavizargar et al. 2018).

Presenilin-1 (PS-1; STM-1; E5-1; AD) Ca2+ leak channel (part of the ?-secretase complex; expression alters the lipid raft composition in neuronal membranes (Eckert and Müller, 2009)). The first 5 TMSs of presenilin-1 are homologous to the 5 TMS CD47 antigenic protein, a constituent of the osteoclast fusion complex (1.N.1.1.1), and CD47 is therefore a presenilin homologue (unpublished observations).  The active site of gamma-secretase resides in an aqueous catalytic pore within the lipid bilayer and is tapered around the catalytic aspartates (Sato et al. 2006). TMS 6 and TMS 7 contribute to the hydrophilic pore. Residues at the luminal portion of TMS 6 are predicted to form a subsite for substrate or inhibitor binding on the a-helix facing the hydrophilic milieu, whereas those around the GxGD catalytic motif within TMS 7 are water accessible (Sato et al. 2006).

Presenilin homologue (DUF1119) of 301 aas and 9 TMSs with known 3-d structure. The amino-terminal domain, consisting of TM1-6, forms a horseshoe-shaped structure, surrounding TM7-9 of the carboxy-terminal domain. The two catalytic aspartate residues are located on the cytoplasmic side of TMS 6 and TMS 7, spatially close to each other and approximately 8?Å into the lipid membrane surface. Water molecules gain constant access to the catalytic aspartates through a large cavity between the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. (Li et al. 2013).  Both protease and ion channel activities have been demostrated, and these two activities share the same active site (Kuo et al. 2015). Cleavage is controlled by both positional and chemical factors (Naing et al. 2018).

Copper (Cu+) and silver (Ag+) uptake transporter, Ctr1. The trimeric channel Eisses and Kaplan, 2005) forms an oligomeric pore with each subunit displaying 3 TMSs and 2 metal binding motifs (Lee et al., 2007). TMS2 is sufficient to form the trimer and the MXXM motif bind Ag+ (Dong et al. 2015). Ctr1 mediates basolateral uptakes of Cu+ in enterocytes (Zimnicka et al., 2007) and shows copper-dependent internalization and recycling which provides a reversible mechanism for the regulation of cellular copper entry (Molloy and Kaplan, 2009). It acts as a receptor for the two extinct viruses, CERV1 and CERV2 (Soll et al., 2010). Ctrl takes up platinum anticancer drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin (Du et al., 2012). The 3-d structure is known (Yang et al., 2012).  Ctr1 has a low turn over number of about 10 ions/second/trimer (Maryon et al. 2013).  Methionine and histidine residues in the transmembrane domain are essential for transport of copper, but when mutated, they stimulated uptake of cisplatin (Larson et al. 2010).  Plays important roles in the developing embryo as well as in adult ionic homeostasis (Wee et al. 2013). (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol from green tea, can enhance CTR1 mRNA and protein expression in ovarian cancer cells. EGCG inhibits the rapid degradation of CTR1 induced by cisplatin (cDDP). The combination of EGCG and cDDP increases the accumulation of cDDP and DNA-Pt adducts, and subsequently enhances the sensitivity of ovarian cancer (Wang et al. 2015). Steroid inhibitors may be able to overcome cycplatin resistance (Kadioglu et al. 2015).  Upregulated in colorectal cancer cells (Barresi et al. 2016). The N-terminus of CTR1 binds Cu2+ following transfer from blood copper carriers such as human serum albumin to the transporter (Bossak et al. 2018).

Epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC (regulates salt and fluid homeostasis and blood pressure; regulated by Nedd4 isoforms and SGK1, 2 and 3 kinases) (Henry et al., 2003; Pao 2012).  Cd2+ inhibits a-ENaC by binding to the internal pore where it interacts with residues in TMS2 (Takeda et al., 2007).  The channel is regulated by palmitoylation of the beta subunit which modulates gating (Mueller et al. 2010). ENaCs are more selective for Naa+ over other cations than ASICs (Yang and Palmer 2018). ENaC plays a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (Zhao et al. 2014). The hetrodimeric complex can consist of aß? or dß? subunits, depending on the tissue (Giraldez et al. 2012).  The a- and ?-subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel interact directly with the Na+:Cl- cotransporter, NCC, in the renal distal tubule with functional cosequences, and together they determine bodily salt balance and blood pressure (Mistry et al. 2016).  ENaC is regulated by syntaxins (Saxena et al. 2006). The cryoEM structure has been solved (Noreng et al. 2018).

Neuronal acid-sensing cation channel-1, ASIC1 (>90% identical to ASIC1 of Rat (TC#1.A.6.1.2)). 3D structure (1.9Å resolution) has been solved (Jasti et al., 2007). Regulated by the glucocorticoid-induced kinase-1 isoform 1 (SGK1.1) (Arteaga et al., 2008). Residues in the second transmembrane domain of the ASIC1a that contribute to ion selectivity have been defined (Carattino and Della Vecchia, 2012). Outlines of the pore in open and closed conformations describe the gating mechanism (Li et al., 2011). Interactions between two extracellular linker regions control sustained channel opening (Springauf et al., 2011).  Can form monomers, trimers and tetramers, but the tetramer may be the predominant species in the plasma membrane (van Bemmelen et al. 2015).

Mec-6 is a chaparone protein required for functional insertion (Matthewman et al. 2018). Mec-10 plays a role in the response to mechanical forces such as laminar shear stress (Shi et al. 2016). MEC-4 or MEC-10 mutants that alter the channel's LSS response are primarily clustered between the degenerin site and the selectivity filter, a region that likely forms the narrowest portion of the channel pore (Shi et al. 2018).

An endogenous regulator of P2X3 in bladder is the Pirt protein (TC#8.A.64.1.1) Gao et al. 2015).  X-ray crystal structures of the human P2X3 receptor in apo/resting, agonist-bound/open-pore, agonist-bound/closed-pore/desensitized and antagonist-bound/closed states have been determined (Mansoor et al. 2016). The open state structure harbours an intracellular motif termed the 'cytoplasmic cap', which stabilizes the open state of the ion channel pore and creates lateral, phospholipid-lined cytoplasmic fenestrations for water and ion egress.

In AqpM, isoleucine replaces a key histidine residue found in the lumen of water channels, which becomes a glycine residue in aquaglyceroporins.

Aquaporin 1 (CO2-, O2- and nitrous oxide-permeable and water-selective) (Zwiazek et al. 2017). Aquaporin-1 tunes pain perception by interacting with Na(v)1.8 Na+ channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons (Zhang and Verkman, 2010). It is upregulated in skeletal muscle in muscular dystrophy (Au et al. 2008). AQP1 has been reported to first insert as a four-helical intermediate, where helices 2 and 4 are not inserted into the membrane. In a second step this intermediate is folded into a six-helical topology. During this process, the orientation of the third helix is inverted, and it can shift out the membrane core (Virkki et al. 2014).  Its synthesis is regluated by Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2; Q9Y5W3) which also interacts directly with Aqp1 (Fontijn et al. 2015). A nanoscale ion pump has been derived artificially from Aqp1 (Decker et al. 2017). Mammalian Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) channels activated by cyclic GMP can carry non-selective monovalent cation currents, selectively blocked by arylsulfonamide compounds AqB007 (IC50 170 muM) and AqB011 (IC50 14 muM).

Forms human cataract lens membranes (Buzhynskyy et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2011).  A mutation that causes congenital dominant lens cataracts has been identified (Varadaraj et al. 2008). AqpO catalyzes Zn2+-modulated water permeability as a cooperative tetramer (Nemeth-Cahalan et al., 2007). It transports ascorbic acid (Nakazawa et al., 2011). The Detergent organization around solubilized aquaporin-0 using Small Angle X-ray Scattering has been reported (Berthaud et al., 2012).  Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) in the eye lens is truncated by proteolytic cleavage during lens maturation. This truncated AQP0 is no longer a water channel (Berthaud et al. 2015).  A mutation that causes congenital dominant lens cataracts has been identified (Varadaraj et al. 2008). Cataractogenesis in MIP mutants are probably caused by defects in MIP gene expression in mice (Takahashi et al. 2017).

Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the major water channel in the central nervous system and plays an important role in the brain's water balance, including edema formation and clearance. There are 6 splice variants; the shorter ones assemble into functional, tetrameric square arrays; the longer is palmitoylated on N-terminal cysteyl residues) (Suzuki et al., 2008). The longest, Aqp4e, has a novel N-terminal domain and forms a water channel in the plasma membrane although various shorter variants don't (Moe et al., 2008). AQP4, like AQP0 (1.A.8.8.2), forms water channels but also forms adhesive junctions (Engel et al., 2008) (causes cytotoxic brain swelling in mice (Yang et al., 2008)) Mice lacking Aqp4 have impaired olfactions (Lu et al., 2008). Aqp4 is down regulated in skeletal muscle in muscular dystrophy (Au et al. 2008). The crystal structure is known to 2.8 Å resolution (Tani et al., 2009). The structure reveals 8 water molecules in each of the four channels, supporting a hydrogen-bond isolation mechanism and explains its fast and selective water conduction and proton exclusion (Tani et al., 2009; Cui and Bastien, 2011). It is an important antigen in Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients (Kalluri et al., 2011).  A connection has been made between AQP4-mediated fluid accumulation and post traumatic syringomyelia (Hemley et al. 2013).  AQP4 has increased water permeability at low pH, and His95 is the pH-dependent gate (Kaptan et al. 2015).  Also transports NH3 but not NH4+ (Assentoft et al. 2016). Cerebellar damage following status epilepticus involves down regulation of AQP4 expression (Tang et al. 2017). SUR1-TRPM4 and AQP4 form a complex to increase bulk water influx during astrocyte swelling (Stokum et al. 2017). A mutation, S111T, causes intellectual disability, hearing loss, and progressive gait dysfunction (Berland et al. 2018). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp4, is found in brain > kidney > stomach (Ramírez-Lorca et al. 2006).

Vasopressin-sensitive aquaporin-2 (Aqp2) in the apical membrane of the renal collecting duct (Fenton et al., 2008).  Controls cell volume and thereby influences cell proliferation (Di Giusto et al. 2012).  It  plays a key role in concentrating urine. Water reabsorption is regulated by AQP2 trafficking between intracellular storage vesicles and the apical membrane. This process is tightly controlled by the pituitary hormone arginine vasopressin, and defective trafficking results in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI).  The crystal structure of Aqp2 has been solved to 2.75Å (Frick et al. 2014).  In terrestrial vertebrates, AQP2 function is generally regulated by arginine-vasopressin to accomplish key functions in osmoregulation such as the maintenance of body water homeostasis by a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism (Olesen and Fenton 2017; Martos-Sitcha et al. 2015). AQP2 is expressed in the anterior vaginal wall and fibroblasts, and regulates the expression level of collagen I/III i, suggesting that AQP2 is associated with the pathogenesis of stress urinary incontinence through collagen metabolism during ECM remodeling (Zhang et al. 2017). As in humans, the chicken ortholog, Aqp2, is found only in the kidney (Ramírez-Lorca et al. 2006).

Nicotinic acetylcholine-activated cation-selective channel, pentameric a2ß?d (immature muscle) na2ß?d (mature muscle). A  combination of symmetric and asymmetric motions opens the gate, and the asymmetric motion involves tilting of the TM2 helices (Szarecka et al. 2007). Acetylcholine receptor d subunit mutations underlie a fast-channel myasthenic syndrome and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (Brownlow et al., 2001; Webster et al., 2012). Residues in TMS2 and the cytoplasmic loop linking TMSs 3 and 4 influence conductance, selectivity, gating and desensitization (Peters et al., 2010). nAChR and TRPC channel proteins (1.A.4) mediate nicotine addiction in many animals from humans to worms (Feng et al., 2006). Cholesterol recognition motifs in transmembrane domains of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor have been identified (Baier et al., 2011). Allosteric modulators of the a4ß2 subtype of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the dominant type in the brain, are numerous (Pandya and Yakel, 2011).  a2ß2 and a4ß2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are inhibited by the ß-amyloid(1-42) peptide (Pandya and Yakel, 2011b).  The A272E mutation in the alpha7 subunit gives rise to spinosad insensitivity without affecting activation by acetylcholine (Puinean et al. 2012). Inhibited by general anaesthetics (Nury et al., 2011). The X-ray crystal structures of the extracellular domain of the monomeric state of human neuronal alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and of its complexes with the antagonists methyllycaconitine and alpha-bungarotoxin have been determined at resolutions of 1.8 A, 1.7 A and 2.7 A, respectively (Zouridakis et al. 2014).  Structurally similar allosteric modulators of a7 nAChR exhibit five different pharmacological effects (Gill-Thind et al. 2015).  Mutations causing slow-channel myasthenia show that a valine ring in the channel is optimized for stabilizing gating (Shen et al. 2016).  Quinoline derivatives act as agonists or antagonists depending on the type and subunit (Manetti et al. 2016). Conformational changes stabilize a twisted extracellular domain to promote transmembrane helix tilting, gate dilation, and the formation of a ""bubble"" that collapses to initiate ion conduction (Gupta et al. 2016). A high-affinity cholesterol-binding domain has been proposed for this and other ligand-gated ion channels (Di Scala et al. 2017).

The a4ß2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The NMR structure of the transmembrane domain and the multiple anaesthetic binding sites are known (Bondarenko et al., 2012).  Mutations cause autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE; Díaz-Otero et al. 2000). 
Nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. This system contributes to cognitive functioning through interactions with multiple neurotransmitter systems and is implicated in various CNS disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. It provides an extra layer of molecular complexity by existing in two different stoichiometries determined by the subunit composition. By potentiating the action of an agonist through binding to an allosteric site, positive allosteric modulators can enhance cholinergic neurotransmission (Grupe et al. 2015). Most pentameric receptors are heteromeric. Morales-Perez et al. 2016 presented the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human a4ß2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain.

The alpha7 (a-7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of 502 aas is encoded by the CHRNA7 gene.  Acetylcholine binding induces conformational changes that result in open channel formation; opening is blocked by a-bungarotoxin.  The protein is a homopentamer.  It interacts with RIC3 for proper folding and assembly. The nAChR, but not the glycine receptor, GlyR, exhibits hydrophobic gating (Ivanov et al. 2007). Low resolution NMR structures with associated anesthetics have been reported (Bondarenko et al. 2013).  Allosteric modulators exhibit up to 5 distinct pharmacological effects (Gill-Thind et al. 2015).  Based on pore hydration and size, a high resolution structure for the channel in the open conformation has been proposed (Chiodo et al. 2015). Agonists reduce dyskinesias in both early- and later-stage Parkinson's disease (Zhang et al. 2015). Monoterpenes inhibit the alpha7 receptor in the order: carveol > thymoquinone > carvacrol > menthone > thymol > limonene > eugenole > pulegone = carvone = vanilin. Among the monoterpenes, carveol showed the highest potency (Lozon et al. 2016). A revised structural model has been proposed (Newcombe et al. 2017). In humans, exons 5-10 in CHRNA7 are duplicated and fused to the FAM7A genetic element, giving rise to the hybrid gene CHRFAM7A. Its product, dupalpha7, is a truncated subunit lacking part of the N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain and is associated with neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, and immunomodulation (Lasala et al. 2018). alpha7 and dupalpha7 subunits co-assemble into functional heteromeric receptors, that at least two alpha7 subunits are required for channel opening, and that dupalpha7's presence in the pentameric arrangement does not affect the duration of the potentiated events. Using an alpha7 subunit mutant, activation of (alpha7)2(dupalpha7)3 receptors occurs through ACh binding at the alpha7/alpha7 interfacial binding site (Lasala et al. 2018).

The cation-selective pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, nAChR, with a (461 aas; P02710), ß (493 aas; P02712), ? (506 aas; P02714) and d (522 aas; P02718) subunits.  The transmembrane domain of the uncoupled nAChR adopts a conformation distinct from that of the resting or desensitized state (Sun et al. 2016).  Studies with this receptor have been reviewed (Unwin 2013).  Many small molecules interact with nAChRs including d-tubocurarine, snake venom protein a-bungarotoxin (a-Bgt), and a-conotoxins, neurotoxic peptides from Conus snails. Various more recently discovered compounds of different structural classes also interact with nAChRs including the low-molecular weight alkaloids, pibocin, varacin and makaluvamines C and G. 6-Bromohypaphorine from the mollusk Hermissenda crassicornis does not bind to Torpedo nAChR but behaves as an agonist on human a7 nAChR (Kudryavtsev et al. 2015). Dimethylaniline mimics the low potency and non-competitive actions of lidocaine on nAChRs, as opposed to the high potency and voltage-dependent block by lidocaine (Alberola-Die et al. 2016).  Cholesterol is a potent modulator of the Torpedo nAChR (Baenziger et al. 2017). Cholesterol may play a mechanical role by conferring local rigidity to the membrane so that there is productive coupling between the extracellular and membrane domains, leading to opening of the channel (Unwin 2017).

Adult strychnine-sensitive glycine-inhibited chloride (anion selective) heteropentameric channel (GlyR; GLRA1) consisting of a1- and ß-subunits (Cascio, 2004; Sivilotti, 2010). Ivermectin potentiates glycine-induced channel activation (Wang and Lynch, 2012). Molecular sites for the positive allosteric modulation of glycine receptors by endocannabinoids have been identified (Yévenes and Zeilhofer, 2011). Different subunits contribute asymmetrically to channel conductances via residues in the extracellular domain (Moroni et al., 2011; Xiong et al., 2012). Dominant and recessive mutations in GLRA1 are the major causes of hyperekplexia or startle disease (Gimenez et al., 2012).  Open channel 3-d structures are known (Mowrey et al. 2013).  Desensitization is regulated by interactions between the second and third transmembrane segments which affect the ion channel lumen near its intracellular end. The GABAAR and GlyR pore blocker, picrotoxin (TC# 8.C.1), prevents desensitization (Gielen et al. 2015).  The x-ray structure of the a1 GlyR transmembrane domain has been reported (Moraga-Cid et al. 2015), and residue S296 in hGlyR-alpha1 is involved in potentiation by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Wells et al. 2015).  The structure has also been elucidated by cryo EM (Du et al. 2015) and by x-ray crystalography (Huang et al. 2015). The latter presented a 3.0 A X-ray structure of the human glycine receptor-alpha3 homopentamer in complex with the high affinity, high-specificity antagonist, strychnine. The structure allowed exploration of the molecular recognition of antagonists. Comparisons with previous structures revealed a mechanism for antagonist-induced inactivation of Cys-loop receptors, involving an expansion of the orthosteric binding site in the extracellular domain that is coupled to closure of the ion pore in the transmembrane domain. The GlyR beta8-beta9 loop is an essential regulator of conformational rearrangements during ion channel opening and closing (Schaefer et al. 2017). Association of GlyR with the anchoring protein, gephyrin (Q9NQX3), is due to  a hydrophobic interaction formed by Phe 330 of gephyrin and Phe 398 and Ile 400 of the GlyR beta-loop (Kim et al. 2006). Alcohols and volatile anesthetics enhance the function of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) by binding to a single anaesthetic binding site (Roberts et al. 2006). Aromatic residues in the GlyR M1, M3 and M4 a-helices are essential for receptor function (Tang and Lummis 2018). The neurological disorder, startle disease, is caused by glycinergic dysfunction, mainly due to missense mutations in genes encoding GlyR subunits (GLRA1 and GLRB). Another neurological disease with a phenotype similar to startle disease is a special form of stiff-person syndrome (SPS), which is most probably due to the development of GlyR autoantibodies (Schaefer et al. 2018).

?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-inhibited Cl- channel, type A (a-, ß- ?-subunit precursors), regulated by GABA receptor accessory protein, GABARAP (Luu et al., 2006). The anti-convulsant stiripentol acts directly on the GABA(A) receptor as a positive allosteric modulator (Fisher 2009). The major central endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), also directly acts at GABA(A) receptors to potentiate the receptor at low GABA concentrations (Sigel et al., 2011). The recpetor is also allosterically regulated by neurosteroids via TMS1 of the beta subunit (Baker et al. 2010).  General anesthetic binding site(s) have been identified (Chiara et al., 2012). Hydrophobic anions potently and uncompetitively antagonize GABA (A) receptor function (Chisari et al., 2011). Regulated by neurosteroids; activated by pregnenolone and allopregnenalone (Costa et al., 2012). Different subunits contribute asymmetrically to channel conductances via residues in the extracellular domain (Moroni et al., 2011). Potentiated by general anaesthetics (Nury et al., 2011).  Both the alpha and beta subunits are important for activation by alcohols and anaesthetics (McCracken et al. 2010). Direct physical coupling between the GABA-A receptor (of 4 TMSs) and the KCC2 chloride transporter underlies ionic plasticity in cerebellar purkinje neurons in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Huang et al. 2013).  An anesthetic binding site has been identified (Franks 2015). Desensitization is regulated by interactions between the second and third transmembrane segments which affect the ion channel lumen near its intracellular end. The GABAAR and GlyR pore blocker, picrotoxin (TC# 8.C.1), prevents desensitization (Gielen et al. 2015).  The mechanism of action of methaqualone (2-methyl-3-O-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, Quaalude(R)), a sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug. Methaqualone is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at human alpha1,2,3,5beta2,3gamma2S GABAA receptors (GABAARs) expressed, whereas it displays diverse functionalities at the alpha4,6beta1,2,3delta GABAAR subtypes, ranging from inactivity (alpha4beta1delta), through negative (alpha6beta1delta) or positive allosteric modulation (alpha4beta2delta, alpha6beta2,3delta), to superagonism (alpha4beta3delta) (Hammer et al. 2015).  The thyroid hormone L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) inhibits GABAA receptors at micromolar concentrations and has common features with neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (ALLOP). Westergard et al. 2015 used functional experiments on alpha2beta1gamma2 GABAA receptors to detect competitive interactions between T3 and an agonist (ivermectin, IVM) with a crystallographically determined binding site at subunit interfaces in the transmembrane domain of a homologous receptor (glutamate-gated chloride channel, GluCl). T3 and ALLOP showed competitive effects, supporting the presence of a T3 and ALLOP binding site at one or more subunit interfaces. Residues in the beta3 subunit, at or near the etomidate/propofol binding site(s), form part of the valerenic acid modulator binding pocket (Luger et al. 2015). IV general anesthetics, including propofol, etomidate, alphaxalone, and barbiturates, enhance GABAA receptor activation. These anesthetics bind in transmembrane pockets between subunits of typical synaptic GABAA receptors (Forman and Miller 2016). Carisoprodol can directly gate and allosterically modulate type A GABA (GABAA) receptors (Kumar et al. 2017). The former sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug methaqualone (Quaalude) is a moderately potent, non-selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) (Hammer et al. 2015). A methaqualone analog, 2-phenyl-3-(p-tolyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (PPTQ) exhibits intrinsic activity at micromolar concentrations and potentiates the GABA-evoked signaling at concentrations down to the low-nanomolar range (Madjroh et al. 2018). The PPTQ binding site is allosterically linked with sites targeted by neurosteroids and barbiturates.  Anesthetic pharmacophore binding has been studied (Fahrenbach and Bertaccini 2018). GABAA receptors are modulated via several sites by GABA, benzodiazepines, ethanol, neurosteroids and anaesthetics among others. Amundarain et al. 2018 presented a model of the alpha1beta2gamma2 subtype GABAA receptor in the APO state and in complex with selected ligands, including agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators. Sites in TMSs 2 and 3 are important for alcohol-induced conformational changes (Jung and Harris 2006). Many anesthetics and neurosteroids act through binding to the GABAAR transmembrane domainnad x-ray structures have revealed how a-xalone, a neurosteroid anaesthetic, binds and influences potentiation, activation and desensitization (Chen et al. 2018).

The GABA receptor consisting of a1, ß3, and ?2 subunits.  Heteropentameric receptor for GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. Functions also as the histamine receptor and mediates cellular responses to histamine. Functions as a receptor for diazepines and various anesthetics, such as pentobarbital which bind to separate allosteric effector binding sites. Functions as ligand-gated chloride channel (Jayakar et al. 2015).  GABRA1 mutations are associated with familial juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, sporadic childhood absence epilepsy, idiopathic familial generalized epilepsy, infantile spasms and  Dravet syndrome. Thus, GABRA1 mutations are associated with infantile epilepsy including early onset epileptic encephalopathies including Ohtahara syndrome and West syndrome (Kodera et al. 2016).

The prokaryotic H+-gated ion channel, GlvI or GLIC (Bocquet et al., 2007), solved at 2.9 Å resolution in the open pentameric state (3EHZ_E) (Bocquet et al., 2009; Corringer et al. 2010). The basis for ion selectivity has been reported (Fritsch et al., 2011). Two stage tilting of the pore lining helices results in channel opening and closing (Zhu and Hummer, 2010). The mechanical work of opening the pore is performed primarily on the M2-M3 loop. Strong interactions of this short and conserved loop with the extracellular domain are therefore crucial to couple ligand binding to channel opening. The H+-activated GLIC has an extracellular domain between TMSs M3 and M4 but lacks the intracellular domain (ICD) which is a distinct folding domain (Goyal et al., 2011). The structural basis for alcohol modulation of GLIC has been reported (Howard et al., 2011).  The structure of the M2 TMS indicates that the charge selectivity filter is in the cytoplasmic half of the channel (Parikh et al. 2011).  Below pH 5.0, GLIC desensitizes on a time scale of minutes. During activation, the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes changes involving outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in pore diameter. The lower end of M2 remains relatively immobile (Velisetty et al., 2012). During desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of M2 move closer to form a solvent-occluded barrier and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison to the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of M2 in the closed-state (Velisetty et al. 2012).  Pore opening and closing is well understood (Zhu and Hummer 2010). X-ray structures of general anaesthetics bound to GLIC reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer (Nury et al., 2011). Large blockers bind in the center of the membrane, but divalent transition metal ions bind to the narrow intracellular pore entry (Hilf et al., 2010).  Alcohols and anaesthetics induce structural changes and activate ligand-gated ion channels of the LIC family by binding in intersubunit cavities (Sauguet et al. 2013; Ghosh et al. 2013).  Gating at pH 4 has been visualized by x-ray crystallography (Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al. 2013)  Site-directed spin labeling and x-ray analyses have revealed gating transition motions and mechanisms that distinguish active from desensitized states (Dellisanti et al. 2013; Sauguet et al. 2013).  Gating involves major rearrangements of the interfacial loops (Velisetty et al. 2014).  A single point mutation can change the effect of an anesthetic (desfurane; chloroform) from an inhibitor to a potentiator (Brömstrup et al. 2013).  An interhelix hydrogen bond involving His234 is important for stabilization of the open state (Rienzo et al. 2014).  The outermost M4 TMS makes distinct contributions to the maturation and gating of the related GLIC and ELIC homologs, suggesting that they exhibit divergent mechanisms of channel function (Hénault et al. 2015).  The same allosteric network may underlie the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site (Joseph and Mincer 2016). GLIC and ELIC (TC# 1.A.9.9.1) may represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes (Therien and Baenziger 2017).  Arcario et al. 2017 have demonstrate an anesthetic binding site in GLIC which is accessed through a membrane-embedded tunnel. The anesthetic interacts with a previously known site, resulting in conformational changes that produce a non-conductive state of the channel (Arcario et al. 2017).  The gating mechanism has been studied (Lev et al. 2017). R-Ketamine inhibits members of the LIC family, and the structural and dynamics basis for the assymetric inhibitory modulation of ketamine has been revealed (Ion et al. 2017). Residue E35 has been identified as a key proton-sensing residue, as neutralization of its side chain carboxylate stabilizes the active state. Thus, proton activation occurs allosterically at the level of multiple loci with a key contribution of the coupling interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (Nemecz et al. 2017). General anesthetics can allosterically favor closed channels by binding in the pore or favor open channels via various subsites in the transmembrane domain (Fourati et al. 2018).

The bacterial pentameric Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel, ELIC. A 3.3 Å resolution structure is available (Hilf and Dutzler, 2008; Corringer et al., 2010).  X-ray analyses have identified three distinct binding sites for anaesthetics, one in the channel, one at the end of a TMS, and one in a hydrophobic pocket of the extracellular domain (Spurny et al. 2013).  Motions involving desensitization have been defined (Dellisanti et al. 2013).  Simulations indicate the similarities with and differences between the Acetylcholine receptor (Cheng et al. 2009).  This family includes members with very divergent properties (Gonzalez-Gutierrez and Grosman 2015).  Cysteamine is an agonist for ELIC (Hénault and Baenziger 2016). X-ray structures and functional measurements support a pore-blocking mechanism for the inhibitory action of short-chain alcohols which bind to the TMSs (Chen et al. 2016). GLIC (TC# 1.A.9.8.1) and ELIC may represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes (Therien and Baenziger 2017), and both bind hopenoids at the mamalian cholesterol binding site (Barrantes and Fantini 2016).

Non-structural glycoprotein 4, NSP4 or enterotoxin, of 175 aas and 2 TMSs (Hyser et al. 2012).  A pentatmeric structure of a 53 aas NSP4 fragment has been solved (3MIW).  NSP4 viroporin is involved in activation.  It increases the  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) permeability, resulting in decreased ER calcium stores and activation of plasma membrane (PM) calcium influx channels, ultimately causing the elevation in cytoplasmic calcium (Hyser et al. 2013).  It activates ER calcium store-operated calcium entry (Hyser et al. 2013). NSP4 VPD is a Ca2+/Ba2+-conducting cation-selective viroporin that transports monovalent and divalent cations equally well (Pham et al. 2017).

1.B.1.1.1	
OmpF general porin. OmpF can deliver peptides of >6 KDa (epitopes) including protamine, through the pore lumen from the periplasm to the outside (Housden et al., 2010; Ghale et al. 2014).  For cephalosporin antibiotics, the interaction strength series is ceftriaxone > cefpirome > ceftazidime (Lovelle et al. 2011).  An unfolded protein such as colicin E9 can thread through OmpF from the outside to reach the periplasm (Housden et al. 2013).  Polynucleotides can pass through OmpF (Hadi-Alijanvand and Rouhani 2015). LPS influences the movement of bulk ions (K+ and Cl-), but the ion selectivity of OmpF is mainly affected by bulk ion concentrations (Patel et al. 2016).  OMPs such as OmpF cluster into islands that restrict their lateral mobility, while IMPs generally diffuse throughout the cell. Rassam et al. 2018 demonstrated that when transient, energy-dependent transmembrane connections are formed, IMPs become subjugated by the inherent organisation of OMPs, and that such connections impact IMP function. They showed that while establishing a translocon for import, colicin ColE9 sequesters the IMPs of the proton motive force (PMF)-linked Tol-Pal complex into islands mirroring those of colicin-bound OMPs. Through this imposed organisation, the bacteriocin subverts the outer-membrane stabilizing role of Tol-Pal, blocking its recruitment to cell division sites and slowing membrane constriction. The ordering of IMPs by OMPs via an energised inter-membrane bridge represents an emerging functional paradigm in cell envelope biology (Rassam et al. 2018). Colicin E9 (ColE9) disordered regions exploit OmpF for direction-specific binding, which ensures the constrained presentation of an activating signal within the bacterial periplasm (Housden et al. 2018). Anionic lipid binding can prevent closure of OmpF channels, thereby increasing access of antibiotics that use porin-mediated pathways (Liko et al. 2018). OmpF may be the major route of D-lactate/D-3-hydroxybutyrate oligo-ester secretion (Utsunomia et al. 2017).

The pore of the Hbp TD is largely obstructed, but a variant that lacked one amino acid residue from the N-terminus showed the opening and closing of a channel comparable to what was reported for the TD of NalP. Hbp is processed by an autocatalytic intramolecular mechanism resulting in the stable docking of the a-helical plug in the barrel.

The first stage of autotransporter folding determines whether subsequent translocation can deliver the N-terminal domain to its functional form on the bacterial cell surface. Paired conserved glycine-aromatic 'mortise and tenon' motifs join neighbouring beta-strands in the C-terminal barrel domain, and mutations within these motifs slow the rate and extent of passenger domain translocation to the surface of bacterial cell (Leyton et al. 2014).

1.B.12.9.1	
Autotransporter of N-terminal protease passenger domain that cleaves surface-localized virulence factors.  The 3-d structure is known (Oomen et al., 2004). The crystal structure of the NalP translocator domain revealed a 12 ß-stranded transmembrane beta-barrel containing a central alpha-helix. The transmembrane beta-barrel is stable even in the absence of the alpha-helix. Removal of the helix results in an influx of water into the pore region, suggesting the helix acts as a 'plug' (Khalid and Sansom 2006). The dimensions of the pore fluctuate, but the NalP monomer is sufficient for the transport of the passenger domain in an unfolded or extended conformation (Khalid and Sansom 2006). NalP is subject to phase variation (Oldfield et al. 2013).

BtuB cobalamin receptor (also transports phage C1 DNA across the outer membrane). Two Ca2+ binding sites in BtuB mediate cobalamine binding (Cadieux et al., 2007). Cobalamine uptake into the periplasm is reversible, but efflux is pmf-independent (Cadieux et al., 2007). The 3-d structure is available (PDB#1NQE).  The Ton box and the extracellular substrate binding site are allosterically coupled (bidirectional), and TonB binding may initiate a partial round of transport (Sikora et al. 2016).  Substrate binding to the extracellular surface of the protein triggers the unfolding of an energy coupling motif at the periplasmic surface.  Thus, substrate binding reduces the interaction free energy between certain residues, thereby triggering the unfolding of the energy coupling motif (Lukasik et al. 2007).

A signaling domain in HasR interacts with a partially unfolded periplasmic domain of an antisigma factor, HasS, to control transcription by an ECF sigma factor (Malki et al. 2014).  The HasR domain responsible for signal transfer is highly flexible in two stages of signaling, extends into the periplasm at about 70 to 90 A from the HasR beta-barrel and exhibits local conformational changes in response to the arrival of signaling activators (Wojtowicz et al. 2016).

Outer membrane hemagglutinin secretion protein, FhaC. Functionally important conserved motifs have been identified (Delattre et al., 2010).  The x-ray structure reveals a beta-barrel pore obstructed by two structural elements conserved in all two partner secretion systems, an N-terminal a-helix and an extracellular loop.  FhaC goes from the closed to the open state in the presence of the filamentous haemagglutinin adhesin, FHA.  The N-terminal a-helix is displaced into the periplasm during FHA secretion (Guérin et al. 2014).  With two POTRA domains in the periplasm, a transmembrane beta barrel and a large loop harboring a functionally important motif, FhaC epitomizes the conserved features of the superfamily (Jacob-Dubuisson et al. 2009). The conserved secretion domain of FHA interacts with the POTRA domains, specific extracellular loops and strands of FhaC and the inner beta-barrel surface. The interaction map indicates a funnel-like pathway, with conformationally flexible FHA entering the channel in a non-exclusive manner and exiting along a four-stranded beta-sheet at the surface of the FhaC barrel. This sheet of FhaC guides the secretion domain of FHA along discrete steps of translocation and folding (Baud et al. 2014).  The membrane-proximal POTRA domain exists in several conformations, and the binding of FHA displaces this equilibrium (Guérin et al. 2015).

Non-specific, 14 ß-stranded monomeric OmpG porin (Conlan et al. 2000). pH-induced conformational changes of OmpG have been studied after reconstitution in native E. coli lipids (Mari et al., 2010).  Encoded by a gene in a gene cluster also encoding an ABC sugar uptake system (TC# 3.A.1.1.46), a glucosyl hydrolase and two oxidoreductases.  Therefore it's phsiological function may be glucoside uptake. At neutral/high pH, the channel is open and permeable to substrates of size up to 900Da. At acidic pH, loop L6 folds across the channel and blocks the pore. The channel blockage at acidic pH appears to be triggered by the protonation of a histidine pair on neighboring ß-strands, which repel one another, resulting in the rearrangement of loop L6 and channel closure (Köster et al. 2015).  Crystallization and analysis by electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed the fundamental mechanisms essential for the channel activity.  A 28 aa extension has been added to the 14 ß-TMS barrel to make a 16 ß-TMS barrel with normal activity and stability but differing pH sensitivity (Korkmaz et al. 2015). A minimized OmpG porin of only 220 aas still exhibits gating, but it was 5-fold less frequent than in native OmpG. The residual gating of the minimal pore is independent of L6 rearrangements and involves narrowing of the ion conductance pathway, most probably driven by global stretching-flexing deformations of the membrane-embedded ß-barrel (Grosse et al. 2014).  pH-dependent gating is controlled by an electrostatic interaction network formed between the gating loop and charged residues in the lumen (Perez-Rathke et al. 2018). 3-d structures of the protein in lipid bilayers have been solved (Retel et al. 2017). OmpG may provide a route for D-lactate/D-3-hydroxybutyrate oligo-ester secretion (Utsunomia et al. 2017).

M. smegmatis porin, MspA (cation selective due to a high density of negative charges in the constriction zone, but it transports glucose, serine, hydrophilic ß-lactams and (slowly) phosphate (Wolschendorf et al., 2007)) The MspC paralogue appears to have the same specificity as MspA. Both can also transport fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol but not the larger erythromycin, kanamycin, and vancomycin (Danilchanka et al., 2008). Also allows uptake of ferric iron (Jones and Niederweis, 2010). The 3-d structure is known (PDB#1UUN). It is a ß-barrel with N- and C-termini of their single hairpins on the outside, and their chains run in an anti-clockwise direction around the central pore. Both of these characteristics are opposite in most gram-negative bacterial ß-barrels (Remmert et al., 2010).  Forms octameric voltage-gated nanopores where each subunit contributes 2 TMSs to the 16 stranded ß-barrel (Faller et al. 2004; Rodrigues et al. 2011; Pavlenok et al. 2012) that can be used for nanopore sequencing (Laszlo et al. 2016).

Anion-selective OpdK (OccK1 or OpdK) benzoate/vanillate-selective porin (Tamber et al., 2006; Eren et al., 2012; Liu et al. 2012). The structure of the OpdK porin, specific for vanillate and related small aromatic acids, has been solved by x-ray crystallography (3SYS_A). It is a labile trimer with monomers of an 18 ß-stranded barrel and with an inner diameter of 8Å (Biswas et al., 2008). Other substrates transported (but less well) include 4-nitrobenzoate, caproate, octanoate, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, tetracycline antibiotics, and carbapenem antibioitics (imipenem and meropenem) (Eren et al., 2012).  Molecular dynamic simulations and mutant analyses have been reported (Wang et al. 2012).

Outer membrane biogenesis complex (Wu et al., 2005). YaeT (BamA) may serve as an outer membrane ""receptor"" for the CdiA/CdiB 2-partner secretion system that mediates direct cell-cell contact-dependent growth inhibition (Aoki et al., 2008). High-resolution structures of crystal forms of BamA POTRA4-5 from E. coli has been reported (Zhang et al., 2011; Sinnige et al. 2014). Solid-state NMR on BamA, a large multidomain integral membrane protein, revealed dynamic conformational states (Renault et al., 2011). In contrast to the N-terminal periplasmic polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domains, the C-terminal transmembrane ß-barrel domain of BamA is mechanically much more stable. Exposed to mechanical stress, this ß-barrel stepwise unfolds ß-hairpins until unfolding has been completed. The mechanical stabilities of ß-barrel and ß-hairpins are thereby modulated by the POTRA domains, the membrane composition and the extracellular lid closing the ß-barrel. The NMR structure of SmpA (OmlA) is also known (Vanini et al. 2006).  The periplasmic region of BamA is firmly attached to the ß-barrel and does not experience fast global motion around the angle between POTRA 2 and 3, but the barrel is flexible (Sinnige et al. 2014).  It appears that the BAM complex does not catalyze insertion and assembly of all out membrane (a- and ß-)porins (Dunstan et al. 2015).  YfgL shows significant sequence similarity (e-9) with YxaL/K of Bacillus subtilis. The E. coli periplasmic chaperones, Skp and SurA, and BamA, the central subunit of the BAM complex, have been examined with respect to the folding kinetics of a model OMP (tOmpA) (Schiffrin et al. 2017), showing that prefolded BamA promotes the release of tOmpA from Skp, despite the nM affinity of the Skp for tOmpA. This activity is located in the BamA ß-barrel domain, but is greater when full-length BamA is present, indicating that both the beta-barrel and POTRA domains are required for maximal activity. By contrast, SurA is unable to release tOmpA from Skp, providing direct evidence against a sequential chaperone model. BamA has a greater catalytic effect on tOmpA folding in thicker bilayers, suggesting that BAM catalysis involves lowering the kinetic barrier imposed by the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane (Schiffrin et al. 2017). While BamA is the primary translocator, TamB is involved in folding and maturation of autotransporters (Babu et al. 2018).

1.B.33.2.4	
TamA (YftM) of 577 aas; has a 16 transmembrane ß-stranded ß-barrel with 3 PORTRA domains.  The 2.3 Å crystal structure is known revealing that the barrel is closed by a lid-loop (Gruss et al. 2013).  The C-terminal ß-strand of the barrel forms an unusual inward kink, which weakens the lateral barrel wall and creates a gate for substrate access to the lipid bilayer.  TamA is an Omp85 homologue that may function in autotransporter biogenesis together with TamB (TC# 1.B.22.1.2) and OMP85 (Selkrig et al. 2012). The TAM complex likely evolved from an original combination of BamA and TamB, with a later gene duplication event of BamA, giving rise to an additional Omp85 sequence that evolved to be TamA in Proteobacteria and TamL in Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi (Heinz et al. 2015). Possibly TamB nucleates folding of the passenger domain while TamA/B-BamA interact to catalyze ß-domain membrane insertion and pore enlargement to facmilitate translocation of partially folded autotransporters (M. Babu et al., unpublished hypothesis).

The oligogalacturonate-specific porin, KdgM.  The 3-D structure is known at 1.9 Å resolution (Hutter et al. 2014).  KdgM folds into a 12-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a circular cross-section defining a transmembrane pore with a minimal radius of 3.1 Å. Most loops that face the cell exterior in vivo are disordered but nevertheless mediate contact between densely packed membrane-like layers in the crystal. The channel is lined by two tracks of arginine residues facing each other across the pore, a feature that is conserved within the KdgM family and is likely to facilitate the diffusion of acidic oligosaccharides (Hutter et al. 2014).

The N-acetylneuraminic acid-inducible, anion selective porin, NanC (Condemine et al., 2005). A crystal structure (3.3 Å resolution) is available (2WJQ; Wirth et al., 2009). It forms a 28 Å high 12 stranded ß barrel like the autotransporter, NalP. The pore is lined by basic residues (conserved in other KdgM family members) allowing diffusion of acidic oligosaccharides (Wirth et al., 2009).  Single channels of NanC at pH 7.0 have: (1) conductance 100 to 800 pS in 100 mM: KCl to 3 M: KCl), (2) anion over cation selectivity, and (3) two forms of voltage-dependent gating (channel closures above 200 mV). Phosphate interferes with channel conductance (Giri et al. 2012).

The anaerobically induced outer membrance porin, OprG. Transports small neutral amino acids (Kucharska et al. 2015). The 3-d structure is available (Touw et al. 2010).  Essential for normal biofilm formation (Ritter et al. 2012). It is an eight-stranded ß-barrel monomer that is too narrow to accommodate even the smallest transported amino acid, glycine, raising the question of how OprG facilitates amino acid uptake (Sanganna Gari et al. 2018). Pro-92 of OprG is important for amino acid transport, with a P92A substitution inhibiting transport and the NMR structure of this variant revealing that this substitution produces structural changes in the barrel rim and restricts loop motions. OprG assembles into oligomers in the OM whose subunit interfaces could form a transport channel, and conformational changes in the barrel-loop region may be crucial for its activity (Sanganna Gari et al. 2018).

LPS export porin complex, LptBCFG-A-DE, consists of LptD (Omp; OmpA; 784 aas)-LptE (RlpB; 193 aas; O.M. lipoprotein)-LptA (KdsD; YhbN; OstA small; 185 aas periplasmic chaparone protein)-LptB (KdsC; YhbG; 241 aas cytoplasmic ABC-type ATPase)-LptC (YrbK, 199aas;1 N-terminal TMS)- LptFG, part of the ABC transporter. LptDE (1:1 stoichiometry) comprise a two-protein ß-barrel-lipoprotein complex in the outer membrane that assembles and exports LPS (Chng et al., 2010).  After LPS (or a precursor) is transported across the inner membrane by MsbA (3.A.1.106.1), this seven component system translocates LPS from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer surface of the outer membrane using ATP hydrolysis to sequentially energize transfer from one binding site to another in several steps (Freinkman et al. 2012; Okuda et al. 2012; Sherman et al. 2014).  LPS interacts with LptC and LptA sequentially before being passed to the LptD outer membrane porin, anchored by the LptE lipoprotein on the inner surface of the outer membrane.  LptF and LptG are the transmembrane consituents of the ABC pump, and LptB is the ATPase of an ABC-like system that energizes the transport using several ATP molecules (Okuda et al. 2012; Sherman et al. 2014).  LptC interconnects the LptBFG ABC system with the periplasmic LptA protein via its large periplasmic domain (Villa et al. 2013).  LptDE form a complex in the outer membrane which inserts LPS into this membrane.  The 3-D strcture of the complex shows that the LptE lipoprotein inserts into the 26 stranded barrel of LptD as a plug.  The first two strands of LptD contain prolines and are therefore distorted, possibly creating a portal for lateral diffusion of LPS into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (Qiao et al. 2014).  The 3-d structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LptA, LptH, has been solved at 2:75 Å resolution revealing a ß-jellyroll fold similar to that in LptD (Bollati et al. 2015). Direct interaction of LptB and LptC has been demonstrated (Martorana et al. 2016). A specific binding site in the LptB ATPase for the coupling helices of the transmembrane LptFG complex is responsible for coupling ATP hydrolysis by LptB with LptFG function to achieve LPS extraction (Simpson et al. 2016). After biosynthesis, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are transiently anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM). The ABC transporter LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane. Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa. It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). Transport involves a stable association between the inner (LptBFG) and outer  (LptDE) membrane components, supporting a mechanism in which lipopolysaccharide molecules are pushed one after the other across a protein bridge (LptCA) that connects the inner and outer membranes (Sherman et al. 2018).

An arginine in the pore determines the anion selectivity (Modi et al. 2013).  Residues involved in anion affinity and a preference for Pi versus P2 have been identified (Modi et al. 2015).  Both monomeric and trimeric OprP are belived to maintain their anion selectivity (Niramitranon et al. 2016).

OmpATb (ArfA). The central domain (residues 73-220) has been reported to exhibit channel activity (Molle et al., 2006). However through structural analyses, Teriete et al. (2010) have provided evidence that it does not form a ß-barrel, causing them to propose that it does not have porin activity. Its expression is dependent on small single TMS membrane proteins which are encoded in a single operon with it (Veyron-Churlet et al., 2011). The rv0899 gene is part of an operon (rv0899-rv0901) that is required for fast ammonia secretion, pH neutralization, and growth of M. tuberculosis in acidic environments, and OmpATb may allow secretion (Song et al. 2011).

VDAC1 porin. > 99% identical to human (P21796) and mouse (60932) VDAC1. Mammals possess three VDACs (VDAC1, 2 and 3) encoded by three genes, but they are all similar in sequence (~60-70% identical) (Messina et al., 2011).  The 3-d structure of the human VDAC1 is known (PDB ID 2JK4; Bayrhuber et al. 2008).  Reviewed by Shoshan-Barmatz et al. 2015.  VDAC1 is found both in mitochondria and the plasma membrane (Lawen et al. 2005) where it may cause cytoplasmic ATP loss.. It may be involved in cancer (Shoshan-Barmatz et al. 2017) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Shoshan-Barmatz et al. 2018). Along with its low toxicity profile and high antioxidant activity, the gallic acid derivative, AntiOxBEN3, strongly inhibits calcium-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening (Teixeira et al. 2018). VDAC dimerization plays a role in mitochondrial metabolic regulation and apoptosis in response to cytosolic acidification during cellular stress, and E73 is involved (Bergdoll et al. 2018). Inhibiting VDAC1 overproduction and plasma membrane insertion in ß-cells preserves insulin secretion in diabetes (Zhang et al. 2018).

Colicin E1. Ho et al.

ColE1 induces lipid flipping, consistent with the toroidal (proteolipidic) pore model of channel formation (Sobko et al. 2010).  The mechanism of channel integration involving the transition of the soluble to membrane-bound form has been presented (Lugo et al. 2016).

It forms pores though which the toxin enters the cytoplasm (Parret and De Mot 2000).

1.C.10.1.1	
Haemolysin E, HlyE (ClyA). A peptide derived from the putative transmembrane domain in the tail region of hemolysin E (aas 88-120) assembles in phospholipid membrane and exhibits lytic activity to human red blood cells (Yadav et al., 2009). Residues important for insertion and activity have been identified (Ludwig et al., 2010).  An unusual assembly pathway has been proposed (see family description; Fahie et al. 2013). The pore can be blocked by PAMAM dendrimers (Mandal et al. 2016).  The C-terminus directs pore formation and function (Sathyanarayana et al. 2016).  Similar in structure to Cry6Aa (TC# 1.C.41.2.1) although sequence similarity could not be discerned (Dementiev et al. 2016 and unpublished results).  The C-terminal domain is not directly involved in the pore structure, but is not a passive player in pore formation as it plays important roles in mediating the transition through intermediary steps leading to successful pore formation in a membrane (Sathyanarayana et al. 2016). Transmembrane oligomeric intermediates or "arcs" probably form stable proteolipidic complexes consisting of protein arcs with toroidal lipids lining the free edges (Desikan et al. 2017).

Antimicrobial dermcidin, DCD.  Based on 3-d structural data, dermcidin forms an architecture of high-conductance transmembrane channels, composed of zinc-connected trimers of antiparallel helix pairs. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the unusual membrane permeation pathway for ions and showed adjustment of the pore to various membranes (Song et al. 2013). DCD assembles in solution into a hexameric pre-channel complex before  targeting the membrane and integration, the complex follows a deviation of the barrel stave model (Zeth and Sancho-Vaello 2017).

1.C.11.1.4	
Bifunctional adenylate cyclase-haemolysin toxin precursor, CyaA.  Although homologous, HlyA (1.C.11.1.3) and CyaA  exhibit different modes of permeabilization (Fiser and Konopásek 2009).  A pore model comprising three alpha2-loop-alpha3 hairpins suggested that Gly530XXGly533XXXGly537  in TMS2 could function in toxin oligomerization (Juntapremjit et al. 2015).  Structural integrity of TMSs 1, 2, 3 and 5, but not 4, is important for haemolytic activity, particularly for transmembrane helices 2 and 3 that might form the pore (Powthongchin and Angsuthanasombat 2009). CyaA forms small cation-selective membrane pores that permeabilize cells for potassium efflux, contributing to cytotoxicity of CyaA and eventually provoking colloid-osmotic cell lysis (Wald et al. 2016).  The toxin penetrates myeloid phagocytes expressing the complement receptor 3 and delivers into the cytosol its N-terminal adenylate cyclase enzyme domain (~400 residues). In parallel, the ~1300 residue-long RTX hemolysin moiety of CyaA permeabilizes target cell membranes for efflux of cytosolic potassium ions (Svedova et al. 2016).  Positively-charged side-chains substituted at positions Gln574 and Glu581 in the pore-lining alpha3 enhance hemolytic activity and ion-channel opening, mimicing the highly-active RTX (repeat-in-toxin) cytolysins (Kurehong et al. 2017).

Regenerating islet-derived protein 3a, RegIIIa or Reg3A.  Also called Proliferation-induced Protein 34, PAP or HIP of 157 aas.  It is a C-type intestinal lectin and forms hexameric pores in Gram-positive bacterial membranes.  The 3-d x-ray structure is known (Mukherjee et al. 2014).  Lipopolysaccharides inhibit pore formation, and hence, Gram-negative bacteria are usually not susceptible to its killing action (Mukherjee et al. 2014).

The adiponectin receptor 1 for ADIPOQ, an essential hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism (Tanabe et al. 2015; Yamauchi et al. 2003. Required for normal glucose and fat homeostasis and for maintaining a normal body weight. ADIPOQ-binding activates a signaling cascade that leads to increased AMPK activity, and ultimately to increased fatty acid oxidation, increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogenesis. Has high affinity for globular adiponectin and low affinity for full-length adiponectin. The 3-d structure revealed ceramidase activity for both ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2; however, the two structures are substantially different (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks et al. 2017).

Perfringolysin O, PFO.  Phosphatidylcholine in the outer leaflet increases the cholesterol concentration required to induce PFO binding while phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of asymmetric vesicles stabilized the formation of a deeply inserted conformation that does not form pores, even though it contains transmembrane segments (Lin and London 2014). This conformation may represent an important intermediate stage in PFO pore formation.  Cholesterol recognition, oligomerization, and the conformational changes involved in pore formation have been reviewed (Johnson and Heuck 2014), and the involvement of the D1 domain in structural transitions leading to pore formation has been studied (Kacprzyk-Stokowiec et al. 2014). Interaction of PFO with cholesterol is sufficient to initiate an irreversible sequence of coupled conformational changes that extend throughout the toxin molecule and induce pore formation (Heuck et al. 2007).  Once this transmembrane beta-barrel protein is inserted, PFO assembles into pore-forming oligomers containing 30-50 PFO monomers. These form a pore of up to 300 Å, far exceeding the size of most other proteinaceous pores.  Decreasing the length of the ß-strands causes the pore to shrink (Lin et al. 2015). Site-directed mutagenesis data combined with binding studies performed with different sterols, and molecular modeling are beginning to shed light on the interaction with cholesterol (Savinov and Heuck 2017).

1.C.14.1.1	
Cytohemolysin precursor, HlyA (Vibrio cholerae cytolysin, VCC) is a beta-barrel pore-forming toxin (beta-PFT). A cryo-electron microscopic study revealed low resolution structures for different functional forms (Dutta et al., 2009). Crystal structures of the soluble and transmembrane heptamer reveal common features among disparate pore-forming toxins (De and Olson, 2011). The toxin forms transmembrane heptameric ß-barrel channels with two lectin activities on the ß-prism and the ß-trefoil (Rai et al. 2013).  A ring of tryptophan residues forms the narrowest constriction in the transmembrane channel reminiscent of the phenylalanine clamp identified in anthrax protective antigen (Krantz et al., 2005).  A single point mutation prevents membrane integration and pore formation (Paul and Chattopadhyay 2012).  The deletion of the pre-stem segment does not affect membrane binding and pre-pore oligomer formation, but it critically abrogates the functional pore-forming activity of VCC (Paul and Chattopadhyay 2013).  The membrane-bound monomer can not form pores (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2014).  VCC can be delivered to host cells via extracellular bacterial vesicles (Elluri et al. 2014).  Loops within the membrane-proximal region of VCC play critical roles in determining the functional interactions of the toxin with the membrane lipids that allow pore formation (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2015).  VCC may interfer with signalling in the target cell as well as form pores (Khilwani and Chattopadhyay 2015).  A functional map of the VCC membrane-binding surface has been published (De et al. 2015).  Residues involved in oligomerization have been identified (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2016). The multiple membrane interaction mechanisms of VCC have been reviewed (Kathuria and Chattopadhyay 2018). A model of the transmembrane pore has been presented that accounts for some of its properties (Pantano and Montecucco 2006).

a-Hemolysin (alpha haemolysin; Hly; Hla; a-toxin). Fragments (13-293 aas) form heptamers like the native full length protein, but a fragment with aas 72-293 formed heptamers, octamers and nonamers. All formed Cl- permeable ß-barrel channels (Vécsey-Semjén et al., 2010). The 3-d structure is available (PDB#7AHL). Both symmetry and size of cyclodextrin inhibitors and the toxin pore are important for effective inhibition (Yannakopoulou et al., 2011).  Oxoxylin A inhibits hemolysis by hindering self assembly of the hepatmeric pore in which two ß-strands are contributed by each subunit (Song et al. 1996; Dong et al. 2013).  Applications of pore-forming a-haemolysin include small- and macromolecule-sensing, targeted cancer therapy, and drug delivery (Gurnev and Nestorovich 2014). Sugawara et al. 2015 studied pore formation. Structural comparisons among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions in which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond betweem Asp45 and Try118. This action initiates the protrusion of the prestem. A Y118F mutant and the N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch for pore formation. A dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation was proposed (Sugawara et al. 2015). Release of ATP from cells may occur directly through transmembrane pores formed by a-toxin (Baaske et al. 2016).

The LL-37 (LL37) peptide (cathelicidin) selectively permeabilizes the membranes of apoptotic human leukocytes, leaving viable cells unaffected (Björstad et al., 2009).

LL-37 interacts with lipids and shows the formation of oligomers generating fibril-like supramolecular structures on membranes before it assembles into transmembrane pores expressing a modification of the toroidal pore model (Zeth and Sancho-Vaello 2017). Stable transmembrane pore formation occurs at 2.0-10.0 mµM (Lozeau et al. 2018).

Pro-protegrin-1 (PG-1) (149aas;1 N-terminal TMS) produced by porcine leukocytes. It forms an anion-selective ß-sheet toroidal channel of 8 ß-hairpins in a consecutive NCCN packing organization, yielding both parallel and antiparallel ß-sheets (Jang et al., 2008; Capone et al., 2010). The 3-d structure is known. 97% identical to protegrin-2 (1.C.33.1.1).  A model of the protein in Gram-negative bacterial membranes has been proposed (Bolintineanu et al. 2012).  Protegrin peptides form octameric pores, and about 100 pores are sufficient to kill E. coli (Bolintineanu et al. 2010). The membrane-bound structure, lipid interactions, and dynamics of the arginine-rich beta-hairpin antimicrobial peptide PG-1 as studied by solid-state NMR are described by Tang and Hong 2009.  Protegrin stabilizes partial lipid-forming pores (Prieto et al. 2014).  A model of the protegrin-1 pore has been presented, suggesting that permeability of water through a single PG-1 pore is sufficient to cause fast cell death by osmotic lysis (Langham et al. 2008). Possibly, toroidal pore formation is driven by guanidinium-phosphate complexation, where the cationic Arg residues drag the anionic phosphate groups along as they insert into the hydrophobic part of the membrane (Tang et al. 2007).  Protegrin-1 is an 18-residue beta-hairpin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that forms transmembrane beta-barrels in biological membranes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of various protegrin-1 oligomers on the membrane surface and in transmembrane topologies indicated that protegrin dimers are stable, whereas trimers and tetramers break down (Lipkin et al. 2017). Tetrameric arcs remained stably inserted in lipid membranes, but the pore water was displaced by lipid molecules. Unsheared protegrin beta-barrels opened into beta-sheets that surrounded stable aqueous pores, whereas tilted barrels with sheared hydrogen bonding patterns were stable in most topologies. A third type of pore consisted of multiple small oligomers surrounding a small, partially lipidic pore. Tachyplesin (TC# 1.C.34.1.1) showed less of a tendency to oligomerize than protegrin: the octameric bundle resulted in small pores surrounded by six peptides as monomers and dimers, with some peptides returning to the membrane surface. Theus, multiple configurations of protegrin oligomers may produce aqueous pores (Lipkin et al. 2017).

Cerebroside sulfate activator protein, CSAP or prosaposin (PSAP, GLBA, SAP1) of 524 aas. Saposin A, B, C and D are derived from prosaposin by proteolysis. Saposin-A and C stimulate the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide by beta-glucosylceramidase and galactosylceramide by beta-galactosylceramidase. Saposin-C apparently acts by combining with the enzyme and acidic lipids to form an activated complex, rather than by solubilizing the substrate. Saposin-B stimulates the hydrolysis of galacto-cerebroside sulfate by arylsulfatase A, GM1 gangliosides by ß-galactosidase and globotriaosylceramide by a-galactosidase A. Saposin-B forms a solubilizing complex with the substrates of the sphingolipid hydrolases. Saposin-D is a specific sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase activator. Prosaposin behaves as a myelinotrophic and neurotrophic factor; these effects are mediated by its G-protein-coupled receptors, GPR37 and GPR37L1, undergoing ligand-mediated internalization followed by ERK phosphorylation signaling (Hiraiwa et al. 1999).

IIITCP protein complex, IpaB/IpaC/IpaD. Physical contact with host cells initiates secretion and leads to assembly of a pore, IpaB/IpaC, in the host cell membrane. The active needle tip complex of S. flexneri is composed of a tip protein, IpaD, and the two pore-forming proteins, IpaB and IpaC. The atomic structures of IpaD and a protease-stable coiled-coil fragment in the N-terminal regions of IpaB from S. flexneri and the homologous SipB from Salmonella enterica have been determined (Barta et al. 2012).  Structural comparisons revealed similarity to the coiled-coil regions of pore-forming proteins such as colicin Ia (TC# 1.C.1.1.1).  Interaction between IpaB and IpaD at the needle tip is key to host cell sensing, orchestration of IpaC secretion and its subsequent assembly at needle tips (Veenendaal et al. 2007).

Sticholysin I (cytolysin ST1 or STII or StiII) (Alvarez et al., 2009). Pore formation goes through a dimer intermediate and then generates the active octamer. Disrupting the key hydrophobic interaction between V60 and F163 (FraC numbering scheme) in the oligomerization interface of FraC, equinatoxin II (EqtII) and sticholysin II (StII) impairs the pore formation activity (Mesa-Galloso et al. 2016).

Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) of the strawberry anemone (Structure solved to 1.8 Å resolution; It is a crown-shaped nonamer with an external diameter of about 11.0 nm and an internal diameter of approximately 5.0 nm.) Almost identical to Equinatoxin II (1.C.38.1.1) (Mechaly et al., 2011).  Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) is an a-barrel pore-forming toxin (PFT). The crystal structures of FraC at four different stages of the lytic mechanism have been determined at 3.1Å resolution, namely the water-soluble state, the monomeric lipid-bound form, an assembly intermediate and the fully assembled transmembrane pore (Tanaka et al. 2015). The structure of the transmembrane pore exhibits a unique architecture composed of both protein and lipids, with some of the lipids lining the pore wall, acting as assembly cofactors. The pore exhibits lateral fenestrations that expose the hydrophobic core of the membrane to the aqueous environment. The incorporation of lipids from the target membrane within the structure of the pore provides a membrane-specific trigger for the activation of this haemolytic toxin.  It has been reconstituted in  planar lipid bilayers and engineered for DNA analysis.  It shows a funnel-shaped geometry that allows tight wrapping around single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), resolving between homopolymeric C, T, and A polynucleotide stretches (Wloka et al. 2016). Despite the 1.2 nm internal constriction in the FraC pore, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can translocate through the nanopore at high applied potentials, presumably through deformation of the alpha-helical transmembrane region. Therefore, FraC nanopores might be useful for DNA sequencing and dsDNA analysis. Pore formation goes through a dimer intermediate and then generates the active octamer. Disrupting the key hydrophobic interaction between V60 and F163 (FraC numbering scheme) in the oligomerization interface of FraC, equinatoxin II (EqtII) and sticholysin II (StII) impairs the pore formation activity (Mesa-Galloso et al. 2016).

Expressed constitutively in phagocytes and inducibly in parenchymal tissue-forming cells. It is a transmembrane protein of cytosolic vesicles, derived from multiple organelles that translocate to and fuse with bacterium containing vesicles. Subsequently, Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100 Å pores in the bacterial surface with Perforin-2 cleavage products present in the bacteria. Perforin-2 is also required for the bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as well as hydrolytic enzymes (McCormack et al. 2015). Perforin-2 exists in membrane-bound (P2a) and secretory (P2b) isoforms, both present in human macrophages.P2a promotes fusion of vesicles with lysosomes (Xiong et al. 2017).

1.C.4.1.1	
Aerolysin (ß-hemolysin; cytolytic enterotoxin) precursor (Parker et al., 1994).  Upon transition  from the prepore to pore, the aerolysin heptamer shows a unique concerted swirling movement, accompanied by a vertical collapse of the complex, ultimately leading to the insertion of a transmembrane beta-barrel (Degiacomi et al. 2013).  Multiple conformational states lead to rotation of the core lysin to unleash the membrane spanning regions (Whisstock and Dunstone 2013).  Monomer activation, dependent on proteolysis, is the rate-limiting step for pore formation (Bischofberger et al. 2016). Cryo-electron microscopy structures of three conformational intermediates and the final aerolysin pore provide insight into the conformational changes that allow pore formation. The structures reveal a protein fold consisting of two concentric beta-barrels, tightly kept together by hydrophobic interactions. This fold suggests a basis for the prion-like ultrastability of aerolysin pore and its stoichiometry (Iacovache et al. 2016).

Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA). Many cationic compounds inhibit in nM - mM concentration ranges (Yamini et al. 2016). Both symmetry and size of cyclodextrin inhibitors and the toxin pore are important for effective inhibition (Yannakopoulou et al., 2011).  A cryo electron microscopic structure of the anthrax protective antigen translocon and the N-terminal domain of anthrax lethal factor inserted into a nanodisc model lipid bilayer has been solved revealing a cap, a narrow stalk and a transmembrane channel (Gogol et al. 2013).  Poly(amindo)amine (PAMAM) dentrimers block activity (Förstner et al. 2014).  The 3-d structure of PA, showing the channel and the f-clamp, and providing information about the multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the membrane-spanning channel is formed has been published (Jiang et al. 2015).  The export of the lethal factor and edema factor from the endosome into the host cytosol is dependent on the proton motive force (pmf) (Krantz et al. 2006; Colby and Krantz 2015).

Trp-20 is required for cation selective channel assembly (Kwiatkowska et al., 2007).  Adenosine phosphates control the activity of lysenin channels inserted into planar lipid membranes with respect to their macroscopic conductance and voltage-induced gating. Addition of ATP, ADP, or AMP decreased the macroscopic conductance of lysenin channels in a concentration-dependent manner, with ATP being the most potent inhibitor and AMP the least (Bryant et al. 2016).

Alzheimer''s disease amyloid ß-protein (amino acids 1-42) (Abeta protein or AßP or Aß42).  Aß pores may consist of tetrameric and hexameric beta-sheet subunits (Strodel et al. 2010).  Residues 22 - 35 in the peptide binds cholesterol to form Ca2+-permeable pores (Di Scala et al. 2014).  Cholesterol promotes the insertion of Abeta in the plasma membrane, induces alpha-helical structure formation, and forces the peptide to adopt a tilted topology that favours oligomerization. Bexarotene, an amphipathic drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, competes with cholesterol for binding to Abeta and prevents oligomeric channel formation (Di Scala et al. 2014).

CPE; has been used for suicide gene therapy for selective treatment of claudin-3-and-4-overexpressing tumors (Walther et al., 2011).

The crystal structure of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin displays features of beta-pore-forming toxins (Kitadokoro et al., 2011). The N-terminal region (nCPE) mediates the cytotoxic effect through pore formation in the plasma membrane of the mammalian host cell. The C-terminal region (cCPE) binds to the second extracellular loop of a subset of claudins, Claudin-3 and claudin-4, with high affinity (Veshnyakova et al., 2010). cCPE is not cytotoxic but is a potent modulator of tight junctions.

The ß-barrel pore-forming toxin (PFP), Monalysin.  The soluble monomer is cleaved to yield oligomeric pores.  The structure of a cleaved form lacking the transmembrane domain has been solved by x-ray crystalography and cryo-EM (PDB#4MJT; Leone et al. 2015).  The structure displays an elongated shape, resembling those of beta-pore-forming toxins such as aerolysin, but it lacks the receptor binding domain. Pro-monalysin forms a stable doughnut-like 18-mer complex composed of two disk-shaped nonamers held together by N-terminal swapping of the pro-peptides. This is in contrast with the monomeric pro-form of the other beta-PFTs that are receptor-dependent for membrane interaction. The membrane-spanning region of pro-monalysin is fully buried in the center of the doughnut, suggesting that upon pro-peptide cleavage, the two disk-shaped nonamers can - and have to - dissociate to leave the transmembrane segments free to deploy and lead to pore formation. In contrast with other toxins, the delivery of 18 subunits at once, nearby the cell surface, may be used to by-pass the requirement for a receptor-dependent concentration to reach the threshold for oligomerization into the pore-forming complex (Leone et al. 2015).

Pore-forming exotoxin A (chain A; ExlA)  (Rasper and Merrill 1994; Méré et al., 2005).  Pore-formation has been demonstrated (Zalman and Wisnieski 1985).  Secretion depends on ExlB, a Two Partner Secretion (TPS; TC# 1.B.20) system, as well as type IV pili.  The protein has three domains: an N-terminal hemolyin domain, a central RGD motif domain, and a C-terminal domain required for cell lysis.  Pore-formation precedes lysis (Basso et al. 2017). ExlA triggers cadherin cleavage by promoting calcium influx which activates ADAM10 for proteolysis (Reboud et al. 2017).

a-synuclein (140 aas).

Pleurotolysin A/B pore-forming toxin. Pleurotolysin A (PlyA; also called ostreolysin A, OlyA) binds first in a sphingomyelin-dependent process; Pleurotolysin B (PlyS) binds to A in the membrane and inserts (Kondos et al., 2011).  The binary cytolytic pore-forming complex forms non-selective ion conducting pores of variable size (Schlumberger et al. 2013) to promote fruiting (Ota et al. 2014). Conformational changes accompanying pore formation have been reported (Lukoyanova et al. 2015).   In these systems, the aegerolysin-like proteins provide the membrane cholesterol/sphingomyelin selectivity and recruit oligomerised pleurotolysin B molecules, to create a membrane-inserted pore complex. The resulting protein structure has been imaged with electron microscopy, and it has a 13-meric rosette-like structure, with a central lumen that is ~4-5 nm in diameter. The opened transmembrane pore is non-selectively permeable for ions and smaller neutral solutes, and is a cause of cytolysis of a colloid-osmotic type (Ota et al. 2014).

1.F.1.1.1	
The SNARE fusion complex, fusing neurotransmitter vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Ca2+ acts on the synaptic vesicle synaptotagmin1 (synaptotagmin I; SytI, Syt1, SSVP65, SYT) to trigger rapid exocytosis (Chapman, 2008).  Syt1 is a major Ca2+ sensor for fast neurotransmitter release. It contains tandem Ca2+-binding C2 domains (C2AB), a single transmembrane a-helix and a highly charged 60-residue- long linker in between. The linker region of Syt1 is essential for its two signature functions: Ca2+-independent vesicle docking and Ca2+-dependent fusion pore opening. The linker contains the basic-amino acid-rich N-terminal region and the acidic amino acid-rich C-terminal region (Lai et al. 2013).  The intrinsically disordered region between Syt I's transmembrane helix and the first C2 domain interats with vesicular lipids and modulates Ca2+ binding to C2 (Fealey et al. 2016). t-SNARE and v-SNARE interact in their C-terminal TMSs to promote pore opening (Wu et al. 2016).  Both sides of a trans-SNARE complex can drive pore opening suggesting an indentation model in which multiple SNARE C-termini cooperate in opening the fusion pore by locally deforming the inner leaflets (D'Agostino et al. 2016). The TMSs of SNARE proteins regulate the fusion process (Wu et al. 2017).

Yeast vacuolar snare complex including the vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (Snc2p; 115aas; 1-C-terminal TMS) (Chernomordik et al., 2005), the vacuole morphogenesis protein, Vam3 (PTH1) of 283 aas, the vacuolar v-snare, Nyv1 of 253 aas, and the t-snare, Vti1 of 217 aas. Considering these last three proteins, SNARE TMSs serve as non-specific membrane anchors in vacuole fusion, but fusion requires the SNARE complexes in the plasma and vacuolar membranes. Lipid-anchored Vti1 was fully active, lipid-anchored Nyv1 (R-SNARE) permitted the fusion reaction to proceed up to hemifusion, but lipid-anchored Vam3 interfered with fusion before hemifusion. Vam7 (a soluble SNARE; 316 aas) and Sec18 (758 aas) remodel SNARE compexes to allow lipd-anchored R-SNARE (NYV1, 253 aas), acting with Q-SNARE (VTS1; 523 aas), to support vacuole fusion (Jun et al. 2007).Thus, these proteins have non-specific membrane anchors, but each of these proteins makes different contributions to the hemifusion intermediate and opening of the fusion pore (Semenov et al. 2014). The 181-198 region of Qa-snare, immediately upstream of the SNARE heptad-repeat domain, is required for normal fusion activity with HOPS. This region is needed for normal SNARE complex assembly (Song and Wickner 2017). Sec17 and Sec18 act twice in the fusion cycle, binding to trans-SNARE complexes to accelerate fusion, and then to hydrolyze ATP to disassemble cis-SNARE complexes (Song et al. 2017).

The mouse synaptobrevin 2 (syb2)/VAMP2/Syntaxin (Syx)/SNAP-25 complex involved in vesicle fusion pore formation (Chang et al. 2015). The synaptobrevin juxtamembrane regions plus the TMS may catalyze pore formation by forming a membrane-spanning complex that increases curvature stress at the circumference of the hemifused diaphragm of the prepore intermediate state (Tarafdar et al. 2015). The TMS of VAMP2 plays a critical role membrane fusion, and the structural mobility provided by the central small amino acids is crucial for exocytosis by influencing the molecular re-arrangements of the lipid membrane that are necessary for fusion pore opening and expansion (Hastoy et al. 2017). SNARE TMSs may function as parts of the fusion pores during Ca2+-triggered exocytosis for release of both neurotransmitters and hormones (Chiang et al. 2018).

Ebola virus glycoportein 2 of 676 aas.  The NMR structure of the internal fusion loop of 54 aas has been solved (2LCY) The fusion peptide is 17 aas long (Apellániz et al. 2014). The GP2 protein also encoedes the GP2-d peptide of 40 aas which is a viroporin (He et al. 2017). This nonstructural polypeptide, called the delta peptide, is produced in abundance during Ebola virus infection. Full length and conserved C-terminal delta peptide fragments permeabilize the plasma membranes of nucleated cells, increase ion permeability across confluent cell monolayers and permeabilize synthetic lipid bilayers. Permeabilization activity is dependent on the disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteines. The conserved C-terminal portion of the peptide is biochemically stable in human serum, and most serum-stable fragments have full activity (He et al. 2017).

The p15 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein is a nonstructural viral protein that induces cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation (Top et al. 2012). The small, myristoylated N-terminal ectodomain of p15 lacks any of the defining features of a typical viral fusion protein. NMR and CD spectroscopy indicated that this small fusion module comprises a left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix flanked by small, unstructured N- and C-termini (PDB# 2MNS_A). Individual prolines in the 6-residue proline-rich motif are tolerant to alanine substitutions, but multiple substitutions that disrupt the PPII helix eliminate cell-cell fusion activity. A synthetic p15 ectodomain peptide induces lipid mixing between liposomes. Lipid mixing, liposome aggregation, and stable peptide-membrane interactions are all dependent on both the N-terminal myristate and the presence of the PPII helix. A model for the mechanism of action of this viral fusion peptide, whereby the N-terminal myristate mediates initial, reversible peptide-membrane binding that is stabilized by subsequent amino acid-membrane interactions. These interactions induce a biphasic membrane fusion reaction, with peptide-induced liposome aggregation representing a distinct, rate-limiting event that precedes membrane merger. The PPII helix may function to force solvent exposure of hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the regions flanking the helix to promote membrane binding, apposition, and fusion (Top et al. 2012).

Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-fusion pore-forming protein of 655 aas and 4 TMSS, one N-terminal and three C-terminal but separated by about 100 residues.  Pore formation is blocked by human interferon-induced transmembrane proteins such as IFM3 (Q01628) (Desai et al. 2014).  The only spike of influenza C virus, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein (HEF) combines receptor binding, receptor hydrolysis and membrane fusion activities in a single protein. Like other hemagglutinating glycoproteins of influenza viruses, HEF is S-acylated, but only with stearic acid at a single cysteine located at the cytosol-facing end of the transmembrane region. S-acylation is essential for replication of influenza viruses A, B and C by affecting budding and/or membrane fusion (Wang et al. 2016).

The GP64 transmembrane domain is essential for GP64 trafficking, membrane fusion, virion budding, and virus infectivity but could be replaced only by transmembrane domains from related viral membrane proteins (Li and Blissard 2008).

The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein.  The crystal strcuture is available (McLellan et al. 2013).  The protein has at least 3 conformational states: pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state, and post-fusion hairpin state. During viral and plasma cell membrane fusion, the heptad repeat (HR) regions assume a trimer-of-hairpins structure, positioning the fusion peptide in close proximity to the C-terminal region of the ectodomain. The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and plasma cell membranes which leads to delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Fusion is pH independent and occurs directly at the outer cell membrane. The trimer of F1-F2 (protein F) interacts with glycoprotein G at the virion surface. Upon binding of G to heparan sulfate, the hydrophobic fusion peptide is unmasked and interacts with the cellular membrane, inducing the fusion between host cell and virion membranes. RSV fusion protein is able to interact directly with heparan sulfate and therefore actively participates in virus attachment.

Claudin 2 (Claudin-2) (forms narrow, fluid filled, water-permeable cation-selective paracellular pores) (Angelow et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009).  It is a dimer in a high molecular weight protein complex (Van Itallie et al. 2011; Krug et al. 2014). Transports Na+, K+, smal organic molecules and water through the paracellular channel (Fromm et al. 2017). Site-specific distributions of claudin-2- and claudin-15-based paracellular channels drive their organ-specific functions in the liver, kidney, and intestine (Tanaka et al. 2017). Disruption of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), and in the intestines of patients with IBDs, the expression of CLDN2 is upregulated (Takigawa et al. 2017).

Claudin-15 of 227 aas and 4 TMSs, Cldn15.  Suzuki et al. 2013 reported the crystal structure of mouse claudin-15 at a resolution of 2.4 angstroms. The structure revealed a characteristic ß-sheet fold consisting of two extracellular segments anchored to a transmembrane four-helix bundle by a consensus motif. Potential paracellular pathways with distinctive charges on the extracellular surface provided insight into the molecular basis of ion homeostasis across tight junctions. Site-specific distributions of claudin-2- and claudin-15-based paracellular channels drive their organ-specific functions in the liver, kidney, and intestine (Tanaka et al. 2017).

NPC (Tran and Wente, 2006).  The structure of the NPC core (400kD) has been determined at 7.4 Å resolution revealing a curved Y-shaped architecture with the coat nucleoporin interactions forming the central ""triskeleton"".  32 copies of the coat neucloporin complex (CNC) structure dock into the cryoelectron tomographic reconstruction of the assembled human NPC, thus accountng for ~16 MDa of it's mass (Stuwe et al. 2015).  Import of integral membrane proteins (mono- and polytopic) into the the inner nuclear membrane occurs by an active, transport factor-dependent process (Laba et al. 2015). Ndc1 and Pom52 are partially redundant NPC components that are essential for proper assembly of the NPC. The absence of Ndc1p and Pom152p results in aberrant pores that have enlarged diameters and lack proteinaceous material, leading to increased diffusion between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Madrid et al. 2006).

Fungal Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) with 29 components.  Stuwe et al. 2015 presented the reconstitution of the ~425-kilodalton inner ring complex (IRC), which forms the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, revealing its interaction network and equimolar stoichiometry. The Nsp1Nup49Nup57 channel nucleoporin heterotrimer (CNT) attaches to the IRC solely through the adaptor nucleoporin Nic96. The CNTNic96 structure reveals that Nic96 functions as an assembly sensor that recognizes the three-dimensional architecture of the CNT, thereby mediating the incorporation of a defined CNT state into the NPC. They proposed that the IRC adopts a relatively rigid scaffold that recruits the CNT to primarily form the diffusion barrier of the NPC, rather than enabling channel dilation (Stuwe et al. 2015).

Nuclear Pore Complex, NPC with 86 protein components.  NPCs mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport and gain transport selectivity through nucleoporin FG domains. Chug et al. 2015 reported a structural analysis of the frog FG Nup625854 complex. It comprises a 13 nanometer-long trimerization interface with an unusual 2W3F coil, a canonical heterotrimeric coiled coil, and a kink that enforces a compact six-helix bundle. Nup54 also contains a ferredoxin-like domain. Chug et al. 2015 further identified a heterotrimeric Nup93-binding module for NPC anchorage. The quaternary structure alternations in the Nup62 complex, which were previously proposed to trigger a general gating of the NPC, are incompatible with the trimer structure. Chug et al. 2015 suggested that the highly elongated Nup62 complex projects barrier-forming FG repeats far into the central NPC channel, supporting a barrier that guards the entire cross section. The Sun1/UNC84A protein and Sun2/UNC84B may function redundantly in early HIV-1 infection steps and therefore influence HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis (Schaller et al. 2017).

Baseplate structural protein complex (GP5 is a lysozyme showing limited similarity to ComA of Neisseria species (3.A.11.2.1)) plus Gp18 tail sheath protein of phage T4. Gp5 (575 aas), the baseplate hub subunit, contains (1) an N-terminal GP5_OB domain, (2) a central lysozyme domain, and (3) a C-terminal domain of ~200 aas with repeat units that resemble BigA (1.B.12.5.5; residues 400-600) and ComA (3.A.11.2.1; residues 400-600). Twenty proteins comprise the entire tail complex of T4. See Rossmann et al. 2004 and Leiman et al. 2010) for tabulation of the properties and evidence concerning the functions of these constituents. gp27 and gp29 may comprise the transmembrane channel (Hu et al. 2015).

Fructose uniporter, GLUT5.  The proteins from rat and cow have been crystalized and their structures have been determined in the open outward- and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. On the basis of comparisons of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, a single point mutation proved to be enough to switch the substrate-binding preference from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of E. coli XylE suggested that, in addition to a global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices, TM7 and TM10, underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism (Nomura et al. 2015).  GLUT5 is preferentially used for fructose uptake under (near) anoxic glycolysis to avoid feedback inhibition of phosphofructokinase (Park et al. 2017). Residues involved in fructose recognition have been identified (Ebert et al. 2017).

The erythrocyte/brain hexose facilitator, glucose transporter-1, Gtr1 or Glut1.

Sugar transport has been suggested to function via a sliding mechanism involving several sugar binding sites (Cunningham et al., 2006). Glut1 is the receptor for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)) (Manel et al., 2003). It is regulated by stomatin (TC# 8.A.21) to take up dehydroascorbate (Montel-Hagen et al., 2008). Mutations cause Glut1 deficiency syndrome, a human encephalopathy that results from decreased glucose flux through the blood brain barrier (Pascual et al., 2008).  Mueckler and Makepeace (2009) have presented a model of the exofacial substrate-binding site and helical folding of Glut1. Glut1, 2, 4 and 9 are functional both in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (Takanaga and Frommer, 2010). Glut1 is down-regulated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (Liu et al., 2008b). Metabolic stress rapidly stimulates blood-brain barrier endothelial cell sugar transport by acute up-regulation of plasma membrane GLUT1 levels, possibly involving an AMP-activated kinase activity (Cura and Carruthers, 2010). Serves as a receptor for neuropilin-1 (923aas; 2 TMSs; O14786) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Hoshino, 2012). Glut1 has a nucleotide binding site, and nucleotide binding affects transport activity (Yao and Bajjalieh 2009).  The protein serves as a receptor for dermatin and ß-adducin which help link the spectrin-actin junctional complex to the erythrocyte plasma membrane (Khan et al. 2008).  May play a role in paroxysmal dyskinesias (Erro et al. 2017). GLUT1 mediates infection of CD4+ lymphocytes by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (Jin et al. 2006). Mutations in disordered regions can cause disease by introducing dileucine motifs, For example, mutations that are causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome are of this type and the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments (Meyer et al. 2018).

Xylose (xylopyranose):H+ symporter of 491 aas and 12 TMSs (Wambo et al. 2017).  Also transports and binds D-glucose and 6-bromo-6-deoxy-D-glucose.  The 3-d structure is known in three conformers, outward occluded, inward occluded and inward open (Sun et al. 2012: Quistgaard et al. 2013).  Most of the sugar-binding residues are conserved with the human Glut-1, 2, 3 and 4 homologues.  The coalescence of intramolecular tunnels and cavities has been postulated to account for facilitated diffusion of sugars (Cunningham and Naftalin 2014).

The multidrug (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, norfloxacin, doxorubicin, trimethoprim, acriflavin, ethidium bromide, tetraphenylphosphonium, TPP, benzalkonium, ciprofloxacin, thiamphenicol, IPTG) resistance exporter, MdfA (catalyzes both electrogenic and electroneutral transport) (Adler and Bibi, 2004). Can function as a Na+ (K+)/H+ antiporter (Lewinson and Bibi 2001; Higgins, 2007). Is known to provide resistance to a wide variety of dissimilar toxic compounds, including neutral, cationic and zwitterionic substances.  Crystals that diffracted to 3.4 Å resolution and belonged to the hexagonal space group P6122 have been obtained (Nagarathinam et al. 2017).

For review of MdfA see Lewinson et al., 2006. The conformational switch accompanying transport is induced by promiscuous binding of substrates and/or inhibitors to the binding pocket (Fluman et al., 2009). Normally extrudes monovalent cationic drugs in exchange for a single proton, but it transports divalent cationic drugs poorly. It can be mutated to antiport a divalent cationic drug for 2 protons (Tirosh et al., 2012).

ß- and a-galactopyranoside:H+ symporter, LacY. Transports lactose, melibiose, thio-ß-methyl galactopyranoside (TMG), isopropyl-ß-thiogalactoside (IPTG), 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and galactopyranosyl-1-glycerol. Single point mutations allow transport of sucrose and maltose (King and Wilson 1990).  Crystal structures and modeling reveal the cytoplasmic open state and the periplasmic open state (PDB ID: 1PV7). A structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, revealed the sugar-binding site in a cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation were identified (Abramson et al., 2003; Pendse et al., 2010). The membrane lipid composition determines the topology of LacY (Dowhan and Bogdanov, 2011). Smirnova et al. (2011) have provided evidence that the opening of the periplasmic cavity in LacY is the limiting step for sugar binding. Evidence for an alternating sites mechanism of transport has been summarized (Smirnova et al., 2011). Eames and Kortemme (2012) have shown that when considering expression of the lac operon, LacY function (H+ co-transport) and not protein production is the primary origin of cost fitness. Homology threading of several MFS porters based on the LacY 3-d structure has been reported (Kasho et al., 2006). The alternating-access mechanism has been suggested to arise from inverted topological repeats (Radestock and Forrest, 2011; Madej et al. 2012), but this proposal has been contested (Västermark and Saier 2014; Västermark et al. 2014). Mechanistic features of LacY have been summarized (Kaback 2015). Insertion into the membrane depends on YidC (TC# 2.A.9.3.1) and may occur in a stepwise, stochastic manner employing multiple coexisting pathways to complete the folding process (Serdiuk et al. 2017). The glucose Enzyme IIA (Crr) protein binds LacY to allosterically inhibit its activity, promoting inducer exclusion (Hoischen et al. 1996; Hariharan et al. 2015). Protonated LacY binds D-galactopyranosides specifically, inducing an occluded state that can open to either side of the membrane (Kumar et al. 2014). LacY can form amyloid-like fibrils under destabilizing conditions (Stroobants et al. 2017). Multiple conformations of LacY have been solved (Kumar et al. 2018).

The pathway is between the two halves of the protein and a rocker switch mechanism was proposed (Zheng et al. 2013).  In an in vitro reconstituted system, NarK appeared to be a nitrate/nitrite antiporter.

Glycine betaine transporter, BetP. The x-ray structure is known (3PO3; 2WIT; Ressl et al., 2009). Regulatory crosstalk in the trimeric BetP has been reported (Gärtner et al., 2011). An extracellular K+ -dependent interaction site modulates betaine-binding (Ge et al., 2011). The porter is trimeric and exhibits structural asymmetry (Tsai et al., 2011). The C-terminal domain is involved in osmosensing and is trimeric like wild-type BetP.  The two Na+ binding sites are between TMSs 1 and 8 in the first and second 5 TMS repeats, and between the equivalent TMSs 6 and 3 in the second and first repeats, respectively (Khafizov et al. 2012). interdependent binding of betaine and two sodium ions is observed during the coupling process. All three sites undergo progressive reshaping and dehydration during the alternating-access cycle, with the most optimal coordination of all substrates found in the closed state (Perez et al. 2014). BetP is active and regulated only when negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidyl glycerol are present, and the mechanism has been discussed (Güler et al. 2016).  The K+-sensing C-terminal domain results in K+-dependent cooperative betaine-binding (Ge et al. 2011).

The helices are arranged from helical hairpin pairs to form a central 5-helix transmembrane pore that is gated by a conserved phenylalanine residue.  Gating is controlled by kinase activation.  Selectivity for various anions may be a function of the energetic cost of ion dehydration (Chen et al. 2010).

Glu310 first may bind the carboxyl group of the peptide substrate. Then deprotonation of Glu310 in the inward open state triggers the release of the bound peptide toward the intracellular space, and salt bridge formation between Glu310 and Arg43 induces the transition state to the occluded conformation.

The conformational transition is triggered by the rotation of the kink angles of transmembrane helices 2 and 7 and is mediated by large conformational changes in their adjacent transmembrane helices 1 and 6.  The inward facing conformation contrasts with the outward facing conformation demonstrated for NCX_Mj (TC# 2.A.19.5.3).

Four ion binding sites near the center of the protein are present, one specific for Ca2+ and three probably for Na+. Two passageways allow for Na+ and Ca2+ access from the external side.  However see a more recent analysis reported for 2.A.19.8.2 (Nishizawa et al. 2013).  Transport of both Na+ and Ca2+ requires protonation of D240, but this side chain does not coordinate either ion, implying that the ion exchange stoichiometry is 3:1 and that translocation of Na+ across the membrane is electrogenic although transport of Ca2+ is not (Marinelli et al. 2014).

The authors compare this structure to the outward facing 1.9 Å structure of NCX_Mj (TC# 2.A.19.5.3) and suggest that Ca2+ or H+ binds to the cation-binding site mutually exclusively.  The first and sixth TMSs alternately create hydrophilic cavities on the intra- and extracellluar sides of the membrane.  The inward and outward-facing transitions are triggered by ion binding (Nishizawa et al. 2013).

Sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1 that opens an inner gate required for substrate exit (Watanabe et al., 2010).

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5 HT):Na+:Cl- symporter, SERT.A  Also transports amphetamines; blocked by cocaine and tricyclic antidepressants such as Prozac; interacts directly with the secretory carrier-associated membrane protein-2 (SCAMP2; O15127) to regulate the subcellular distribution (Muller et al., 2006). Uses an alternating sites mechanism with all 3 substrates bound (Zhang and Rudnick, 2006).  Molecular determinants for antidepressants in the human serotonin and norepinephrine Â transporters have been identified (Andersen et al., 2011). A conserved asparagine residue in transmembrane segment 1 (TMS1) of the serotonin transporter dictates chloride-coupled neurotransmitter transport (Henry et al., 2011). The formation and breakage of ionic interactions with amino acids in transmembrane helices 6 and 8 and intracellular loop 1 may be of importance for substrate translocation (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). Methylation of the SLC6A4 gene promoter controls depression in men by an epigenetic mechanism (Devlin et al., 2010).  The 5HT Km is 0.4 micromolar (Banovic et al. 2010).  Regulated allosterically by ATM7 which stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of SERT (Kortagere et al. 2013).  Functional and regulatory mechanisms involving the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains have been considered (Fenollar-Ferrer et al. 2014).  The range of substrates bound and transported has been predicted (Kaufmann et al. 2009).  TMS3 may function in substrate and antagonist recognition (Walline et al. 2008).  The 3-d x-ray structure with antidepressants bound have been solved, leading to mechanistic predictions; antidepressants lock SERT in an outward- open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding (Coleman et al. 2016).  Na+ and cocaine stabilize outward-open conformations of SERT and decrease phosphorylation while agents that stabilize inward-open conformations (e.g., 5-HT, ibogaine) increase phosphorylation. The opposing effects of the inhibitors, cocaine and ibogaine, were each reversed by an excess of the other inhibitor. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Na+ and stimulation by ibogaine occurred at concentrations that induced outward opening and inward opening, respectively (Zhang et al. 2016).  SERT is regulated by multiple molecular mechanisms including its physical interaction with intracellular proteins including the ASCT2 (alanine-serine-cysteine-threonine 2; TC# 2.A.23.3.2), co-expressed with SERT in serotonergic neurons and involved in the transport of small neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane (Seyer et al. 2016).  Transports substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) (Sealover et al. 2016).  A naturally occurring mutation, I425V, associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder and other neuropsychiatric disorders, activates hSERT and eliminates stimulation via the cyclicGMP-dependent pathway (Zhang et al. 2007).  The substituted amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), is a widely used drug of abuse that induces non-exocytotic release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine through their cognate transporters as well as blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitter by the same transporters. In this transporter, Glu394 plays a role in MDMA recognition (Sealover et al. 2016). Intestinal dysbiosis may upregulate SERT expression and contribute to the development of chronic constipation (Cao et al. 2017).

Dopamine transporter.  The 3-d structure is known to 3.0 Å resolution (Penmatsa et al. 2013).  The crystal structure, bound to the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline, shows the transporter locked in an outward-open conformation with nortriptyline wedged between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6 and 8, blocking the transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing conformation. Although the overall structure is similar to that of its prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix 12 halfway across the membrane bilayer, a latch-like carboxy-terminal helix that caps the cytoplasmic gate, and a cholesterol molecule wedged within a groove formed by transmembrane helices 1a, 5 and 7.

The amino acid (leucine):2 Na+ symporter, LeuTAa (Yamashita et al., 2005). LeuT possesses two ion binding sites, NA1 and NA2, both highly specific for Na+ but with differing mechanisms of binding (Noskov and Roux, 2008). X-ray structures have been determined for LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states (Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012).  Extracytoplasmic substrate binding at an allosteric site controls activity (Zhao et al. 2011).  It has been proposed that the 5 TMS repeat derived from a DedA domain (9.B.27; Khafizov et al. 2010).  Mechanistic aspect of Na+ binding have been studied (Perez and Ziegler 2013).  Structural studies of mutant LeuT proteins suggest how antidepressants bind to biogenic amine transporters (Wang et al. 2013).  The detailed mechanism was studied by Zhao and Noskov, 2013.  Uptake involves movement of the substrate amino acid from the outward facing binding site, S1, to the inward facing binding site, S2, coupled with confrmational changes in the protein (Cheng and Bahar 2013).  The complete substrate translocation pathway has been proposed (Cheng and Bahar 2014). The inward facing conformation of LeuT has been solved (Grouleff et al. 2015).  Substrate-induced unlocking of the inner gatemay determinethe catalytic efficiency of the transporter (Billesbølle et al. 2015). Of the two Na+ binding sites, occupation of Na2 stabilizes outward-facing conformations presumably through a direct interaction between Na+ and transmembrane helices 1 and 8 whereas Na+ binding at Na1 influences conformational change through a network of intermediary interactions (Tavoulari et al. 2015). TMS1A movements revealed a substantially different inward-open conformation in lipid bilayer from that inferred from the crystal structure, especiallly with respect to the inner vestibule (Sohail et al. 2016). Partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1, 5, 6 and7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state (Merkle et al. 2018). A conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site is required for substrate binding to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains (Zhang et al. 2018).

Neurotransmitter:sodium symporter of 455 aas, MhsT.  The x-ray structures of two occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and L-tryptophan have been solved (4US4; Malinauskaite et al. 2014).  These structures provide insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na+2 site. Solvation through this TMS 5 pathway may facilitate Na+ release from the Na+2 site to the inward-open state (Malinauskaite et al. 2014). TMS5 plays a role in the binding and release of Na+ from the Na+2 site and in mediating conformational changes (Stolzenberg et al. 2017).

Archaeal aspartate transporter, Gltph (GltPh) (3-D structure known; 3V8F and 3V8G) (Boudker et al., 2007; Yernool et al., 2004). Cotransports aspartate with 2 Na+ (Ryan et al., 2009) or 3 Na+ (Groeneveld and Slotboom, 2010) or 1Na+ plus 1 H+ plus 1 K+ (Machtens et al. 2015). Reyes et al. (2009) have solved the structure of the inward facing state by cysteine crosslinking. The loop between TMSs 3 and 4 plays an essential role in transport (Compton et al., 2010). Gltph shows opposite movement of the external gate upon binding cotransported sodium compared with substrate (Focke et al., 2011).  The transport pathway and the conformational changes involved have been suggested based on modeling studies (Stolzenberg et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2018).  Individual transport domains may alternate between periods of quiescence and periods of rapid transitions.  The switch to the dynamic mode may be due to separation of the transport domain from the trimeric scaffold which precedes domain movements across the bilayer (Akyuz et al. 2013). This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be rate determining in the transport cycle.  Interactions between the transporter and specific lipids in artificial membranes have revealed effects on activity, and mechanisms have been proposed (McIlwain et al. 2015).  The system can also function as an anion channel (Machtens et al. 2015).

Human UCP2; implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including protection from oxidative stress, negative regulation of glucose sensing systems and the adaptation of fatty acid oxidation capacity to starvation. Not involved in thermogenesis as is UCP1 (Azzu and Brand, 2009). Leucine zipper EF hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LetM1; 2.A.97) and uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2/3) contribute to two distinct mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake pathways (Waldeck-Weiermair et al., 2011).  Transports protons and chloride ions; activated by fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides (Hoang et al. 2012).  Reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in response to intracellular Ca2+ release in pancreatic beta cells (Alam et al. 2012).  Arginine residues in TMS2 are important for chloride transport without affecting fatty acid-dependent proton transport (Hoang et al. 2015).

Homodimeric electrogenic arginine (Km=80µM):agmatine antiporter, AdiC, involved in extreme acid resistance (Fang et al., 2007; Gong et al., 2003; Iyer et al., 2003). A projection structure at 6.5 Å resolution has been published (Casagrande et al., 2008), and the 3.2 Å resolution X-ray structure was determined by Fang et al., 2009 and Gao et al., 2009. Protonation of glutamate 208 induces release of agmatine in the outward-facing conformation (Zomot and Bahar, 2011). The 3.0 Å structure of an Arg-bound form in an open-to-out conformation completed the picture of the major states of the porter during the transport cycle (Kowalczyk et al., 2011).

Glutamate:GABA antiporter, GadC (YcaM). GadC, transports GABA/Glu only under acidic conditions, with no detectable activity at pH ?values higher than 6.5 (Ma et al., 2012). Ma et al. (2012) determined the crystal structure of GadC at 3.1?Å resolution under basic conditions. GadC, comprising 12 TMSs, exists in a closed state, with its carboxy-terminal domain serving as a plug to block an otherwise inward-open conformation. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed the essential transport residues, identified the transport path and suggested a transport mechanism involving the rigid-body rotation of a helical bundle for GadC and other amino acid antiporters.

Anion exchanger (HCO3-:Cl- antiporter; also called Band 3, transports a variety of inorganic and organic anions. Anionic phospholipids are ''flipped'' from one monolayer to the other in erythrocytes and the nephron). Mutations cause Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) hereditary spherocytosis and distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) with impaired acid secretion in humans (Chu et al., 2010; Kittanakom et al., 2008; Toye et al., 2008). Activated by glycophorin A (Stewart et al., 2011). Kanadaptin (SLC4a1; Q9BWU0) has been reported to interact with kidney AE1 (Chen et al. 1998), but Kittanakom et al. 2005 could not detect this interaction. Hübner et al. 2002, 2003 reported nuclear and mitochondrial targetting of kanadaptin.  Some point mutations allow the normally electroneutral anion exchanger to catalyze Na+ and K+ conductance or induce a cation leak in the still functional anion exchanger. A structural model of the AE1 membrane spanning domain, based on the structure of Uracil-proton symporter, suggests that there is a unique transport site comprising TMSs 3-5 and 8 that may function in anion exchange and cation leak (Barneaud-Rocca et al. 2013). The spectrin-actin-based cytoskeletal network is attached to the plasma membrane through interactions with ankyrin, which binds to both spectrin and a beta-hairpin loop in the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (Stefanovic et al. 2007). A detailed transport mechanism has been proposed: It involves an elevator-like motion of the substrate-binding domain relative to the nearly stationary dimerization domain and to the membrane plane (Ficici et al. 2017). The structure-function relationships of band 3 have been reviewed (Abbas et al. 2018).

NhaA Na+:2H+ antiporter (structure determined and mechanism proposed (Williams, 2000; Hunte et al., 2005; Olkhova et al., 2006; Screpanti et al., 2006; Arkin et al., 2007)). The K300R mutant is also electrogenic (Calinescu et al. 2017).  TMS II lines the cation passage, and Asp65 is critical for pH activation of the antiporter (Herz et al., 2010). NhaA is subject to pH-activation of the ion-translocating conformation (Appel et al., 2009; Diab et al., 2011). A periplasm-facing state of the NhaA antiporter suggests the molecular underpinnings of the pH-induced conformational changes (Schushan et al., 2012).  A central unwound part of TMS IV appears to line the cation passage channel (Rimon et al. 2012).  TMSs VI and VII are absent from many homologues, are not required for transport or its regulation and function in assembly and stability (Padan et al. 2015). pH-induced conformational changes have been documented (Kozachkov et al. 2007).

Na /H exchanger-1 (NHE1).  Stoichiometry = 1:1. TMS VI of NHE1 is a discontinuous pore-lining helix with residues Asn(227), Ile(233), and Leu(243) lining the translocation pore (Tzeng et al., 2010). (orthologous to NHE1 of rat, TC# 2.A.36.1.1). It regulates internal pH in human monocytes and is important in heart disease and cancer (Tsai et al. 2015). Structural studies have been performed using NMR and EPR (Lee et al., 2011; Nygaard et al. 2011).  Extracytoplasmic loops contribute to ion coordination and inhibitor sensitivity (Lee et al. 2012).  The regulation of NHE1 has been reviewed (Wakabayashi et al. 2013).  CD44 (LHR, MDU2, MDU3, MIC4; P16070) regulates breast cancer metastasis by regulating NHE1 expression (Chang et al. 2014).  The role of NHE1 in kidney proximal tubule functions, including pH regulation, vectorial Na+ transport, cell volume control and cell survival has been reviewed (Parker et al. 2015).  Helix M9 and the adjacent exofacial re-entrant loop 5 between M9 and M10 (EL5) are important elements involved in cation transport and inhibitor sensitivity (Jinadasa et al. 2015).  A 12 TMS topology has been confirmed (Liu et al. 2015).  Mutations  cause Lichtenstein-Knorr syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition that associates sensorineural hearing loss with cerebellar ataxia (Guissart et al. 2015). Cleaved FAS ligand (transmembrane CD95L; 1 TMS; P48023) activates NHE1 through the Akt/ROCK1 signalling pathway to stimulate cell motility (Monet et al. 2016). NHE1 may contribute to internal pH and motility of mammalian sperm (Muzzachi et al. 2018). The intracellular loop, IL5 is critical for proton sensing and ion transport (Wong et al. 2018). NHE1 and CD44 (the hyaluronan receptor with 742 aas and 2 TMSs, one at the N-terminus and one at the C-terminus (P16070)) appear to play important roles in cardiac remodeling (Suleiman et al. 2018).

This structure is contrasted with that of the distantly related bacterial NhaA; these two structures are quite different in detail, but similar within the 6 TMS repeat unit.

The ion is coordinated by three acidic side chains, a water molecule, a serine and a main-chain carbonyl in an unwound stretch of TMS 5 at the deepest point of a negatively charged cytoplasmic funnel. A second narrow polar channel may facilitate proton uptake from the cytoplasm. Transport activity is cooperative at pH 6 but not at pH 5, due to pH-dependent allosteric coupling of protomers through two histidines at the dimer interface (Wöhlert et al. 2014).

The structure (3.8 Å resolution) reveals a homodimer interconnected at the cytoplasmic domain through four Zn2+ ions. A 6 TMS bundle features of a tetrahedral Zn2+ binding site (Lu and Fu, 2007).

Putative magnetosome membrane iron transporter, MamM.  Forms a heterodimeric stable complex with MamB which it stabilizes.  MamB; see 2.A.4.7.3) also interacts with other proteins including the PDZ1 domain of MamE (Q6NE61).  Both MamB and MamM are essential for magnetite biomineralization and are involved in several steps in magnetosome formation, but only MamB is essential for formation of magnetosome membrane vesicles (Uebe et al. 2011).  Implicated in iron uptake due to homology with other CDF transporters. Most CDF proteins contain two domains, the cation transporting transmembrane domain and the regulatory cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD). A MamM M250P mutation that is synonymous with the disease-related mutation L349P of the human CDF protein, ZnT-10 causes severe structural changes in its CTD, resulting in abnormally reduced function.Thus, the CTD fold is critical for the CDF proteins' proper function and suggest that the CDF cytoplasmic domain is a CDF regulatory element (Barber-Zucker et al. 2016).

Uracil permease, UraA. The crystal structure of UraA with bound uracil at 2.8 Å resolution is available (PDB: 3QE7) (Lu et al., 2011). UraA has a novel structural fold, with 14 TMSs divided into two inverted repeats. A pair of antiparallel ß-strands is located between TMS3 and TMS10 and has an important role in structural organization and substrate recognition. The structure is spatially arranged into a core domain and a gate domain. Uracil, located at the interface between the two domains, is coordinated mainly by residues from the core domain. Structural analysis suggests that alternating access of the substrate may be achieved through conformational changes of the gate domain.  Multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of the UraA symporter in phospholipid bilayers revealed a closed state with 3 high affinity binding sites for cardolipin (Kalli et al. 2015).The crystal structure of UraA bound to uracil in an occluded state at 2.5 A resolution (Yu et al. 2017). UraA shows substantial motions between the core domain and the gate domain as well as intra-domain rearrangements of the gate domain. The occluded UraA forms a dimer wherein the gate domains are sandwiched by two core domains. Dimer formation is necessary for transport activity (Yu et al. 2017).

High affinity uric acid-xanthine permease, UapA. Functionaly critical residues in transmembrane segments 1 and 3 have been identified (Amillis et al., 2011). The substrate recognition and transport pathway have been proposed (Kosti et al., 2012; Kosti et al. 2010).  UapA oligomerization is essential for membrane trafficking and turnover and is a common theme in fungi and mammalian cells (Martzoukou et al. 2015).  Specificity is determined by the interactions of a given substrate with the TMS8-9 loop and by interactions of this loop with TMS1 and TMS12 (Papageorgiou et al. 2008). F528 and Q408 in TMS 12 are important for substrate recognition, and mutation of the former results in high efficiency uptake of several purines and pyrimidines not otherwise transported (Vlanti et al. 2006). A high resolution structure of UapA is available, and it is formed from two domains, a core domain and a gate domain, similar to the previously solved uracil transporter UraA, which belongs to the same family (Alguel et al. 2016). The structure shows UapA in an inward-facing conformation with xanthine bound to residues in the core domain. Unlike UraA, which is a monomer, UapA forms a dimer in the crystals with dimer interactions formed exclusively through the gate domain. Analysis of dominant negative mutants is consistent with dimerization playing a key role in transport. Alguel et al. 2016 postulated that UapA uses an elevator transport mechanism likely to be shared with other structurally homologous transporters including anion exchangers and prestin.

Cl-:H+ (2:1) antiporter, EriC or ClcA (ClC-ecl) (Accardi and Miller, 2004). The x-ray structure has been determined (PDB 1OTS) Dutzler et al., 2002, 2003). The exchange mechanism involves a conformational cycle of alternating exposure of Cl- and H+ binding sites of both ClC pores to the two sides of the membrane (Miloshevsky et al., 2010). Specific aspects of these conformational changes have been proposed (Wang et al. 2018).  Although the protein is present as a homodimer, a single ClC subunit alone is the basic functional unit for transport, and cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl-/H+ exchange in ClC transporters (Robertson et al., 2010).  Glu202 is essential for H+ symport and is on the H+ pathway (Lim et al. 2012).  CLC exchangers have two gates that are coupled through conformational rearrangements outside the ion pathway (Basilio et al. 2014).  The rotation of E148 plays a critical role in defining the Cl-/H+ coupling (Lee et al. 2016). The channel shows conserved re-entrant helix-coil-helix domains (Tsirigos et al. 2017).

Bicarbonate transporter, DauA (YchM). Also transports dicarboxylic acids including fumarate, aspartate and succinate, and is therefore designated the dicarboxylic acid uptake system A (DauA) (Karinou et al. 2013) It is the only succinate uptake porter at acidic pHs. The STAS domain forms a complex with the acyl carrier protein, ACP and malonyl-ACP, and the complex has been determined by x-ray crystallography (PDB# 3NY7).  This complex links bicarbonate and dicarboxylate transport in some way with fatty acid biosynthesis (Moraes and Reithmeier 2012).

Cu+ /Ag+ efflux pump, CusABCF (may pump ions from the periplasm to the external medium); CusF is a periplasmic Cu+ /Ag+ binding receptor essential for full resistance (Franke et al., 2003). Bagai et al. (2007) reported that CusB (MFP) binds one molecule of Ag+ or Cu+ via four conserved methionines and induces a substrate-linked conformational change (Bagai et al., 2007). The crystal structures of CusB are available (Su et al., 2009). The crystal structure of the CusAB complex has been solved (PDB# 3K07) (Su et al., 2011a). CusC is listed under TC# 1.B.17.3.5. The metal-binding methionines play a role in restricting the substrates to monovalent heavy metals (Conroy et al., 2010). It has been reported to export L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). Crystal structures of the CusA efflux pump suggested that methionine residues in a 3-methionine cluster, bind the metal as a transport intermediate (Long et al., 2010). Four methionine pairs in the transmembrane region, and one in the periplasmic domain may comprise the channel. Cu+ is exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic chaparone, CusF in the extracellular space (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2014). The Cus efflux system removes Cu+ and Ag+ from both the cell cytoplasm and the periplasm (Su et al., 2011b; Delmar et al. 2014). Metal-bound CusB is required for activation of Cu+ transfer from CusF directly to a site in the CusA antiporter (Chacón et al. 2014). Metal transfer occurs between CusF and apo-CusB, and when metal-loaded, CusB plays a role in the regulation of metal ion transfer from CusF to CusA in the periplasm.  The ratio of CusA (RND):CusB (MFP):CusC (OMF) is 3:6:3 (Delmar et al. 2013).

Multidrug/dye/detergent/bile salt/organic solvent resistance pump (substrates include: chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones, lipophilic ß-lactams, norfloxacin, doxorubicin, novobiocin, rifampin, trimethoprim, acriflavin, crystal violet, ethidium, disinfectants, rhodamine-6G, TPP, benzalkonium, SDS, Triton X-100, deoxycholate/bile salts/organic solvents (alkanes), growth inhibitory steroid hormones (estradiola and progesterone), and phospholipids) (Elkins and Mullis, 2006). Lateral entry of substrates from the lipid bilayer into AcrB and its homologues has been proposed (Yu et al., 2003a; 2003b). [An asymmetric trimeric structure is established with AcrA having a hexameric structure, and TolC having a trimeric structure (Seeger et al., 2006]. A structure of a complex with YajC is also known (Törnroth-Horsefield et al., 2007). A covalently linked trimer of AcrB provides evidence for a peristaltic pump, alternative access, rotation mechanism (Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2009;Nikaido and Takatsuka, 2009; Pos, 2009) Further evidence for a rotatory mechanisms stems from kinetic analyses for cephalosporin efflux which can exhibit positive cooperativity (Nagano and Nikaido, 2009). May also export signaling molecules for cell-cell communication (Yang et al., 2006). The substrates may be captured in the lower cleft region of AcrB, then transported through the binding pocket, the gate, and finally to the AcrA funnel that connects AcrB to TolC (Husain & Nikaido et al., 2010).  AcrB has been converted into a light-driven proton pump using delta-rhodopsin (dR) linked to AcrB via a glycophorin A transmembrane domain. This created a solar powered protein capable of selectively capturing antibiotics from bulk solutions (Kapoor and Wendell 2013).  The trimeric structure is essential for activity (Ye et al. 2014).  Association with AcrZ (TC# 8.A.50), a small 1 TMS protein (49 aas) that modifies the substrate specificity of AcrAB, has been demonstrated (Hobbs et al. 2012).  In a similar way, the binding of YajC to AcrB stimulates the export of ampicillin (Törnroth-Horsefield et al. 2007). AcrZ binds to AcrB in a concave surface of the transmembrane domain (Du et al. 2015).  Substrate binding accelerates conformational transitions and substrate dissociation, demonstrating cooperativity (Wang et al. 2015). The overall structure of AcrAB-TolC exemplifies the adaptor bridging model, wherein the funnel-like AcrA hexamer forms an intermeshing cogwheel interaction with the alpha-barrel tip region of TolC. Direct interaction between AcrB and TolC is not allowed (Kim et al. 2015).  TMS2 in AcrB is required for lipophilic carboxylate binding. A groove shaped by the interface between TMS1 and TMS2 specifically binds fusidic acid and other lipophilic carboxylated drugs (Oswald et al. 2016). After ligand binding, a proton may bind to an acidic residue(s) in the transmembrane domain, i.e., Asp407 or Asp408, within the putative network of electrostatically interacting residues, which also include Lys940 and Thr978, and this may initiate a series of conformational changes that result in drug expulsion (Su et al. 2006). His978 is probably on the H+ pathway (Takatsuka and Nikaido 2006). AcrAB-TolC segregates to the old pole following cell division, causing the two daughter cells to exhibit different drug resistances (Bergmiller et al. 2017). The hoisting-loop is a highly flexible hinge that enables conformational energy transmission (Zwama et al. 2017). AcrB exhibits three distinct conformational states in the transport cycle, substrate access, binding, and extrusion, or loose (L), tight (T), and open (O) states, respectively (Yue et al. 2017). Simulations show that both Asp407 and Asp408 are deprotonated in the L/T states, while only Asp408 is protonated in the O state. Release of a proton from Asp408 in the O state results in large conformational changes.  Simulations offer dynamic details of how proton release drives the O-to-L transition in AcrB (Yue et al. 2017).  The three-dimensional structures of the homo-trimer complexes of AcrB-like transporters, and a three-step functional rotation helps to explain the mechanism of transport, but a more comprehensive model has been proposed (Zhang et al. 2017). Preparation of the trimeric complex (AcrAB/TolC) for cryo EM has been described (Du et al. 2018). The structural and energetic basis behind coupling functional rotation to proton translocation has been presented (Matsunaga et al. 2018). Protonation of  transmembrane Asp408 in the drug-bound protomer drives rotation. The conformational pathway identifies vertical shear motions among several transmembrane helices, which regulate alternate access of water as well as peristaltic motions that pump drugs into the periplasm (Matsunaga et al. 2018).

All three interact with each other. MexA promotes assembly and stability of the complex (Nehme and Poole, 2007)). Exports ß-lactams, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, macrolides, chloramphenicol, biocides, and a toxic indole compound, CBR-4830, that targets the MreB actin (Robertson et al., 2007). Confers tolerance to tea tree oil and its monoterpene components Terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole and a-terpineol (Papadopoulos et al., 2008) as well as the antimicrobial peptide, colistin (Pamp et al., 2008) (Mao et al., 2002; Poole, 2008).

Protein translocase subunit SecDF.  The 3-dimensional structure is known at 3.3 Å resolution (Tsukazaki et al. 2011).  SecDF serves several functions, such as stabilizing other Sec translocon components within the membrane, maintaining the transmembrane (TM) potential, and facilitating the ATP-independent stage of the translocation mechanism. SecDF also undergoes functionally important conformational changes that involve mainly its P1-head domain, and these changes are coupled with the proton motive force (?pmf). Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with umbrella sampling, Ficici et al. 2017 studied the P1-head conformational change and how it is coupled to the pmf. They reported potentials of mean force along a root-mean-square-distance-based reaction coordinate obtained in the presence and absence of the TM electrical potential. Their results showed that the interaction of the P1 domain dipole moment with the TM electrical field lowers the free-energy barrier in the direction of the F-form to I-form transition, two conformations that vary by the relative positioning of the P1-head subdomainthe large periplasmic domain of TtSecDFwhich is suggested to undergo a hinge motion (Ficici et al. 2017).

Niemann-Pick C1 and C2 disease proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, together may form a lipid/cholesterol exporter from lysosomes to other cellular sites including the plasma membrane (Sleat et al., 2004; Kennedy et al. 2014). NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency causes lysosomal retention of cholesterol, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and glycolipids as well as neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Infante et al. 2008a).  Increased mitochondrial cholesterol, observed in NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency, causes oxidative stress and increased rates of glycolysis and lactate release (Kennedy et al. 2014).  NPC1 binds cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and various oxysterols (Infante et al. 2008b; Liu et al., 2009 ). Soluble NPC2 binds cholesterol, and then passes it to the N-terminal domain of membranous NPC1 (Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009). Cholesterol trafficking in Niemann-Pick C-deficient cells was reviewed by Peake and Vance (2010). NPC1 is a late-endosomal membrane protein involved in trafficking of LDL- derived cholesterol, Niemann-Pick disease type C, and Ebola virus infection.  It is the Ebola virus receptor. It contains 13 TMSs, five of which are thought to represent a """"sterol-sensing domain"""", also present in other key regulatory proteins of cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, and signaling. A crystal structure of a large fragment of human NPC1 at 3.6 Å resolution revealed internal twofold pseudosymmetry along TMSs 2-13 and two structurally homologous domains that protrude 60 Å into the endosomal lumen (Li et al. 2016). NPC1's sterol sensing domain forms a cavity that is accessible from both the luminal bilayer leaflet and the endosomal lumen; this cavity is large enough to accommodate one cholesterol molecule. A model was proposed for  cholesterol sensing and transport (Li et al. 2016).  Lysosomal cholesterol activates TORC1 via an SLC38A9-Niemann-Pick C1 signaling complex (Castellano et al. 2017).  Gong et al. 2016 presented a 4.4 Å structure of the full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains three distinct lumenal domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMSs 2-13 exhibit a typical RND fold, among which TMSs 3-7 constitute the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through domain C (Gong et al. 2016).

The effects of disease-causing mutations on quality control pathways involving the lysosome and endoplasmic reticulum, and how it functions to clear the most common mutant protein found in Niemann-Pick type C patients have been reviewed (Schultz et al. 2016). In the same review, knowledge concerning the mechanisms that degrade misfolded transmembrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is presented. Cholesterol esters are components of low density lipoprotein (LDL), which is brought into the cells of various tissues by targeted endocytosis. Within the endosomes, cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed, releasing free cholesterol, which is finally exported out of the endosome by NPC1 with assistance from a soluble protein NPC2 (Nikaido 2018). The transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half (the SSD, sterol-sensing domain) of NPC1 are homologous to the sterol-binding domains of HMG-CoA reductase, as well as the regulator of cholesterol-regulated transcription activation, SCAP. The domain that binds cholesterol with the highest affinity, within NPC1, however, is the NTD. In the NPC2-NPC1 complex, the substrate is captured at a location far away from the membrane by NPC2, and then is brought to a location close to the membrane surface (NTD of NPC1), and is finally moved to the intramembranous region of NPC1.

Liver/intestinal enterocyte brush border Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein; responsible for ezetimibe-sensitive absorption of luminal lipids and cholesterol via a transport mechanism (Altmann et al., 2004; Davies et al., 2005; Liscum, 2007, Dixit et al. 2007). NPC1L1-dependent sterol uptake seems to be a clathrin-mediated endocytic process and is regulated by cellular cholesterol content (Betters and Yu, 2010; Jia et al., 2011).  Dietary cholesterol induces trafficking of the intestinal NPC1L1 from the brush boarder to endosomes (Skov et al. 2011).  It distributes on the brush border membranes of enterocytes and the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. It is the target of ezetimibe, a hypocholesterolemic drug which blocks internalization of NPC1L1 and cholesterol in the mouse small intestine (Wang and Song 2012; Xie et al. 2012). Human NPC1L1 is a 1,332-amino acid protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that shows sequence homology to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). NPC1L1 may have evolved at two sites (apical membrane of enterocytes and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes) to mediate cholesterol uptake through a clathrin-mediated endocytic process, protecting the body against fecal and biliary loss of cholesterol (Yu 2008).

TatABCE translocase. Early contacts between substrate proteins and TatA have been demonstrated (Fröbel et al., 2011). TatC helix 5 and the TatB transmembrane helix interact (Kneuper et al., 2012).  TatC functions as an obligate oligomer (Cleon et al. 2015). TatA is the most abundant component of the complex and facilitates assembly of this complex.It exhibits a uniform distribution throughout the inner membrane, but forms linear clusters upon increased expression of TatBC (Smith et al. 2017).  TatA and TatB both have the capacity to bind at two TatC sites, one in TMS5 and one in TMS6 (Habersetzer et al. 2017). However in vivo this is regulated according to the activation state of the complex. In the resting-state system, TatB binds the polar cluster site in TMS 5 with TatA occupying the site in TMS 6. However, when the system is activated by overproduction of a substrate, TatA and TatB switch binding sites. Habersetzer et al. 2017 proposed that this substrate-triggered positional exchange is a key step in the assembly of an active Tat translocase. A  highly conserved glutamate residue in the transmembrane region of E. coli TatC, which, when modified by DCCD, interferes with the deep insertion of a Tat signal peptide into the TatBC receptor complex (Blümmel et al. 2017).

Lu et al. an identified an uncommon cation-p interaction in the Na+-binding site located outside the drug-binding cavity and validated the biological relevance of both the substrate- and cation-binding sites by conducting drug resistance and transport assays. Additionally, they observed a potential rearrangement of at least two transmembrane helices upon Na+-induced drug export. They suggested that Na+ triggers multidrug extrusion by inducing protein conformational changes rather than by directly competing for the substrate-binding amino acids.

The 3-d x-ray structure (3.65Å resolution) is available (He et al., 2010). Ion binding and internal hydration have been studied by molecular dynamics simulations (Vanni et al., 2012).  NorM simultaneously couples drug export to the sodium-motive force and the proton-motive force. Residues involved and protein regions that play important roles in Na+ or H+ binding have been identified (Jin et al. 2014). Na+- and H+-driven conformational changes are facilitated by a network of polar residues in the N-terminal domain cavity, whereas conserved carboxylates buried in the C-terminal domain are critical for stabilizing the drug-bound state. These results establish the role of ion-coupled conformational dynamics in the functional cycle and implicate H+ in the doxorubicin release mechanism (Claxton et al. 2018).

Multidrug:proton antiporter of the DinF subfamily.  The structure has been solved to 3.2 Å resolution with and without the substrate, Rhodamine 6 G.  The 12 TMSs show asymmetry with a membrane-embedded substrate-binding chamber.  Direct competition between the H+ and the substrate during transport was suggested (Lu et al. 2013).  However, the opposite was suggested for a sodium antiporter (see TC# 2.A.66.1.10).

2.A.68.1.4	
YdaH transporter of 492 aas with p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate uptake activity.  The crystal structure is known (Bolla et al. 2015). The crystal structure reveals a dimeric molecule with an architecture distinct from other families of transporters. YdaH is a bowl-shaped dimer with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm to halfway across the membrane bilayer. Each subunit of the transporter contains nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins that suggest a  pathway for substrate transport. YdaH could act as an antibiotic efflux pump and mediate bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs (Bolla et al. 2015).  MtrF (TC#2.A.68.1.2) and YdaH as well as the dicarboxylate transporter, INDY (TC#2.a.47.5.2) have been shown to have similar 3-d folds (Vergara-Jaque et al. 2015), confirming the assignment of these two families to the same superfamily (Prakash et al. 2003).

2.A.7.1.3	
Small cationic multidrug efflux pump (substrates: cationic lipophilic drugs), EmrE. This pump confers resistance to a wide range of disinfectants and dyes known as quaternary cation compounds (QCCs). The 3-D structure of the dimeric EmrE shows opposite orientation of the two subunits in the membrane (Chen et al., 2007), and this conclusion has been confirmed (Fleishman et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2008; Lloris-Garcerá et al. 2013). There may be a single intermediate state in which the substrate is occluded and immobile (Basting et al., 2008).  Direct interaction between substrates (tetraphenylphosphonium, TPP+ and MTP+) and Glu14 in TMS1 has been demonstrated using solid state NMR (Ong et al. 2013). A Gly90X6Gly97 motif is important for dimer formation (Elbaz et al., 2008).  Two models may account for the opposite (inverted) orientations of the two identical subunits. A post-translational model posits that topology remains malleable after synthesis and becomes fixed once the dimer forms. A second, co-translational model, posits that the protein inserts in both topologies in equal proportions (Woodall et al. 2015).  Protonation of E14 leads to rotation and tilt of transmembrane helices 1-3 in conjunction with repacking of loops, conformational changes that alter the coordination of the bound substrate and modulate its access to the binding site from the lipid bilayer. The transport model that emerges posits a proton-bound, but occluded, resting state. Substrate binding from the inner leaflet of the bilayer releases the protons and triggers alternating access between inward- and outward-facing conformations of the substrate-loaded transporter, thus enabling antiport without dissipation of the proton gradient (Dastvan et al. 2016). TMS4 is the known dimerization domain of EmrE (Julius et al. 2017). Few conserved residues are essential for drug polyselectivity. Aromatic QCC selection involves a greater portion of conserved residues compared to other QCCs (Saleh et al. 2018).
     The topologies of helical membrane proteins are generally defined during insertion of the transmembrane helices, yet topology can change after insertion. In EmrE, topology flipping occurs so that the populations in both orientations equalize. Woodall et al. 2017 demonstrated that when EmrE is forced to insert in a distorted topology, topology flipping of the first TMS can occur, and topological malleability also extends to the C-terminal helix; even complete inversion of the entire EmrE protein can occur after the full protein is translated and inserted. Thus, topological rearrangements appear to be possible during biogenesis. Subtle but significant differences in the sizes of EmrE with different QCC ligands bound has been reported (Qazi and Turner 2018).

Thiamin transporter, ThiT (Thiamin ECF transporter S component) (Rodionov et al. 2002; Rodionov et al., 2009). High affinity thiamin transporter ThiT (Ka=120 pM). Other substrates include TPP, TMP and pyrithiamin with nM binding constants at 1:1 stoichiometry (protein:ligand). Binding depends on a tryptophan-rich loop between TMSs 5 and 6 (Erkens and Slotboom, 2010). Erkens et al. (2011) presented the crystal structure of the thiamine-specific S-component of the ECF-type ABC transporter, ThiT from Lactococcus lactis at 2.0 Å. Extensive protein-substrate interactions explain its high binding affinity for thiamine (Kd ~ 10-10 M). ThiT has a fold similar to that of the riboflavin-specific S-component RibU, with which it shares only 14% sequence identity. Two alanines in a conserved motif (AxxxA) located on the membrane-embedded surface of the S-components mediate the interaction with the energizing module. A general transport mechanism for ECF transporters has been proposed (Erkens et al., 2011).  Substrate binding induces conformational changes in ThiT (Majsnerowska et al. 2013).

60 kDa inner membrane protein, YidC (involved in insertion of a wide range of membrane proteins, including anaerobic respiratory complexes (Price and Driessen, 2008). The thrid TMS in YidC contacts the substrate protein (Yu et al., 2008).  YidC occupies the lateral gate of the SecYEG translocase and is sequentially displaced by the nascent membrane protein (Sachelaru et al. 2013).  Residues involved in interaction with the Sec translocon have been identified (Li et al. 2014). YidC acts as a flexible chaperone, facilitating LacY folding (Zhu et al. 2013; Hennon and Dalbey 2014).  The structure of the dimeric insertion pore associated with the translating ribosome has been solved (Kohler et al. 2009).  A single copy of YidC interacts with the ribosome at the ribosomal tunnel; a site for membrane protein insertion at the YidC protein-lipid interface has been identified (Wickles et al. 2014).  The crystal structure of full-length E. coli YidC revealed that a hydrophilic groove, formed by five transmembrane helices, is a conserved structural feature as compared to the previous YidC structure from Bacillus halodurans, which lacks a periplasmic domain. Structural mapping of the substrate- or Sec protein-contact sites suggested the importance of the groove for the YidC functions as a chaperone and an insertase (Kumazaki et al. 2014).

The TolA energy-transducing system. The H+-channel-forming TolQ/R proteins are listed under TC# 1.A.30.2.2.  Proteins of the complex listed here are TolA, TolB, YbgF and Pal.  They play a role in outer membrane stabilization and uptake of colicins, but not energizaton of outer membrane receptors (OMRs: TC# 1.B.14).  May function in phospholipid transport (SS Chng, personal communication).  Cells lacking the Tol-Pal complex exhibit defects in lipid asymmetry and accumulate excess phospholipids (PLs) in the OM. This imbalance in OM lipids is due to defective retrograde PL transport in the absence of a functional Tol-Pal complex. Thus, cells ensure the assembly of a stable OM by maintaining an excess flux of PLs to the OM only to return the surplus to the inner membrane via transport mediated by the Tol-Pal complex (Shrivastava et al. 2017).  The specific function of the Tol-Pal complex may be to transport lipids from the outer leaflet of the outer membrane to the inner leaflet of the outer member. The Tol-Pal complex is essential to maintain polar localization of the MCP chemotaxis receptor complex (Santos et al. 2014). The Tol-Pal complex, energized by TolQRA, and using the outer membrane proteins, BtuB and OmpF as receptors, is responsible for the uptake of colicin ColE9 and other bacteriocins; in this process, the complex in the outer membrane bridges and immobilizes the complex components in the inner membrane (Rassam et al. 2018).

3.A.1.1.1	
Maltooligosaccharide porter. The 3-D structure has been reported by Oldham et al. (2007). An altering access mechanism has been suggested for the maltose transporter resulting from rigid-body rotations (Khare et al., 2009). Bordignon et al. (2010) and Schneider et al. (2012) have reviewed the extensive knowledge available on MalEFGK2, its mode of action and its regulatory interactions.  The transporter sequesters the MalT transcriptional activator at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in the absence of the transport substrate (Richet et al. 2012).  The crystal structures of the transporter complex MBP-MalFGK2 bound with large malto-oligosaccharide in two different conformational states have also been determined. In the pretranslocation structure, Oldham et al. 2013 found that the transmembrane subunit MalG forms two hydrogen bonds with malto-oligosaccharide at the reducing end. In the outward-facing conformation, the transmrembrane subunit MalF binds three glucosyl units from the nonreducing end. These structural features explain why large modified malto-oligosaccharides are not transported by MalFGK2 despite their high binding affinity to MBP. In the transport cycle, substrate is channeled from MBP into the transmembrane pathway with a polarity such that both MBP and MalFGK2 contribute to the overall substrate selectivity of the system (Oldham et al. 2013).  Stabilization of the semi-open MalK2 conformation by maltose-bound MBP is key to the coupling of maltose transport to ATP hydrolysis in vivo, because it facilitates the progression of the MalK dimer from the open to the semi-open conformation, from which it can proceed to hydrolyze ATP (Alvarez et al. 2015). Both the binding of MalE to the periplasmic side of the transmembrane complex and binding of ATP to MalK2 are necessary to facilitate the conformational change from the inward-facing state to the occluded state, in which MalK2 is completely dimerized (Hsu et al. 2017).

Alginate (MW 27,000 Da) (and Alginate oligosaccharides) uptake porter. Sphingomonas species A1 is a 'pit-forming' bacterium that directly incorporates alginate into its cytoplasm through a pit-dependent transport system, termed a 'superchannel' (Murata et al., 2008). The pit is a novel organ acquired through the fluidity and reconstitution of cell surface molecules, and through cooperation with the transport machinery in the cells. It confers upon bacterial cells a more efficient way to secure and assimilate macromolecules (Murata et al., 2008).  The substrate-transport characteristics and quaternary structure of AlgM1M2SS with AlgQ1 have been determined (Maruyama et al. 2015). The addition of poly- or oligoalginate enhanced the ATPase activity of reconstituted AlgM1M2SS coupled with one of the periplasmic solute-binding proteins, AlgQ1 or AlgQ2. External fluorescence-labeled oligoalginates were specifically imported into AlgM1M2SS-containing proteoliposomes in the presence of AlgQ2, ATP, and Mg2+. The crystal structure of AlgQ2-bound AlgM1M2SS adopts an inward-facing conformation. The interaction between AlgQ2 and AlgM1M2SS induces the formation of an alginate-binding tunnel-like structure accessible to solvent. The translocation route inside the transmembrane domains contains charged residues suitable for the import of acidic saccharides (Maruyama et al. 2015).

Phospholipid, LPS, lipid A and drug exporter, MsbA, which flips the substrate from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer leaflet (Eckford and Sharom, 2010). MsbA also confers drug resistance to azidopine, daunomycin, vinblastine, Hoechst 33342 and ethidium (Reuter et al., 2003). Four x-ray structures, trapped in different conformations, two with and two without nucleotide, have been solved (Ward et al., 2007). They suggest an alternating accessibility mode of transport with major conformational changes.  The mechanism and conformational transitions have been discussed (Moradi and Tajkhorshid 2013).  MsbA is energized both by ATP hydrolysis and the H+ electrochemical gradient (Singh et al. 2016). Mi et al. 2017 used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of lipid-nanodisc-embedded MsbA in three functional states. The 4.2 Å-resolution structure of the transmembrane domains of nucleotide-free MsbA revealed that LPS binds deeply inside MsbA at the height of the periplasmic leaflet. Two sub-nanometre-resolution structures of MsbA with ADP-vanadate and ADP revealed a closed and an inward-facing conformation, respectively. A  2.9 A resolution structure of MsbA in complex with G907, a selective small-molecule antagonist with bactericidal activity, revealed an unanticipated mechanism of ABC transporter inhibition. G907 traps MsbA in an inward-facing, lipopolysaccharide-bound conformation by wedging into an architecturally conserved transmembrane pocket. A second allosteric mechanism of antagonism occurs through structural and functional uncoupling of the nucleotide-binding domains (Ho et al. 2018).

3.A.1.106.15	
Lipid flippase, PglK or WlaB, of 564 aas and 6 N-terminal TMSs with a C-terminal ATPase domain.  Mediates the ATP-dependent translocation of an undecaprenylpyrophosphate-linked heptasaccharide intermediate across the cell membrane, an essential step during the N-linked protein glycosylation pathway. Transport across the membrane is effected via ATP-driven conformation changes. Most likely, only the polar and charged part of the glycolipid enter the substrate-binding cavity, and the lipid tail remains exposed to the membrane lipids during the transmembrane flipping process (Alaimo et al. 2006; Kelly et al. 2006; Perez et al. 2015).

The cyclic peptide antibiotic, microcin J25 (MccJ25; the precursor peptide is JcjA) exporter, the self immunity protein, McjD. TolC is also required for export; Vincent and Morero, 2009.  The 3-d structure has been determined to 2.7Å resolution in an outward occluded state (Choudhury et al. 2014).  Binding and efflux as well as stimulation of the ATPase activity upon binding of MccJ25 have been demonstrated (Choudhury et al. 2014).  This is one of two MCCJ25 exporters, the other being YojI (TC# 3.A.1.113.3).

3.A.1.122.1	
Macrolide (14- and 15- but not 16-membered lactone macrolides including erythromycin) exporter, MacAB (formerly YbjYZ). Both MacA and MacB are required for activity (Tikhonova et al., 2007). MacAB functions with TolC to export multiple drugs and heat-stable enterotoxin II (enterotoxin STII) (Yamanaka et al., 2008). The crystal structure of MacA is available (Yum et al., 2009). MacB is a dimer whose ATPase activity and macrolide-binding capacity are regulated by the membrane fusion protein MacA (Lin et al., 2009). Xu et al. (2009) have reported the crystal structure of the periplasmic region of MacB which they claim resembles the periplasmic domain of RND-type transporters such as AcrB (TC# 2.A.6.2.2). Also exports L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). The periplasmic membrane proximal domain of MacA acts as a switch in stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by the MacB transporter (Modali and Zgurskaya, 2011). Fitzpatrick et al. 2017 presented an electron cryo-microscopy structure of the tripartite assembly (MacAB-TolC) at near-atomic resolution. A hexamer of the periplasmic protein MacA bridges a TolC trimer in the outer membrane to a MacB dimer in the inner membrane, generating a quaternary structure with a central channel for substrate translocation. A gating ring found in MacA may act as a one-way valve in substrate transport. The MacB structure features an atypical transmembrane domain with a closely packed dimer interface and a periplasmic opening that is the likely portal for substrate entry from the periplasm, with subsequent displacement through an allosteric transport mechanism (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). The structure of ATP-bound MacB has been solved, revealing precise molecular details of its mechanism (Crow et al. 2017). MacB has a fold that is different from other structurally characterized ABC transporters and uses a unique molecular mechanism termed mechanotransmission. Unlike other bacterial ABC transporters, MacB does not transport substrates across the inner membrane in which it is based, but instead couples cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis with transmembrane conformational changes that are used to perform work in the extra-cytoplasmic space. In the MacAB-TolC tripartite pump, mechanotransmission drives efflux of antibiotics and export of a protein toxin from the periplasmic space via the TolC exit duct. Homologous tripartite systems from pathogenic bacteria similarly export protein-like signaling molecules, virulence factors and siderophores (Greene et al. 2018).

ABC transporter of unknown function, but aspects of its structure and mechanism of action are known (Yuan et al. 2001; Zoghbi and Altenberg 2013).  Nucleotide-binding domain dimerization occurs as a result of binding to the natural nucleotide triphosphates, ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP, as well as the analog ATP-gamma-S. All the natural nucleotide triphosphates are hydrolyzed at similar rates, whereas ATP-gamma-S is not hydrolyzed. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, frequently assumed to produce the nucleotide-bound conformation, failed to elicit nucleotide-binding domain dimerization (Fendley et al. 2016).

Vitamin B12 porter. The 3-D structure of BtuCDF has been solved to 2.6 Å (Hvorup et al., 2007). The conformational transition pathways of BtuCD has been revealed by targeted molecular dynamics simulation (Weng et al., 2012). Asymmetric states of BtuCD are not discriminated by its cognate substrate binding protein BtuF (Korkhov et al., 2012).  ATP hydrolysis occurs at the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) dimer interface, whereas substrate translocation takes place at the translocation pathway between the TM subunits, which is more than 30 angstroms away from the NBD dimer interface.  Hydrolysis of ATP appears to facilitate substrate translocation by opening the cytoplasmic end of translocation pathway (Pan et al. 2016).

The hetrodimeric ABC transporter, TM287/TM288.  The 2.9-Å crystal structure has been solved in the inward-facing state. The two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) remain in contact through an interface involving conserved motifs that connect the two ATP hydrolysis sites.  AMP-PNP binds to a degenerate catalytic site which deviates from the consensus sequence in the same positions as the eukaryotic homologs, CFTR (TC# 3.A.1.202.1) and TAP1-TAP2 (TC# 3.A.1.209.1) (Hohl et al. 2012).  The structural basis for allosteric crosstalk (positive cooperativity) between the two ATP binding sites has been studied (Hohl et al. 2014).  The two NBDs exhibit unexpected differences and flexibility (Bukowska et al. 2015). It exports daunomycin and the nonfluorescent 2,7-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethylester (BCECF-AM) (Hohl et al. 2012). Timachi et al. 2017 observed hydrolysis-independent closure of the NBD dimer, further stabilized as the consensus site nucleotide is committed to hydrolysis.

Transcription of the operon is controlled by the Mn2+-activated (not Zn2+- or Fe2+-activated) repressor, TroR (153 aas, acc# F7IW50;) TroR contains a metal-binding domain homologous to the YtgC-R protein (3.A.1.15.12) which has the membrane domain of this ABC transporter (N-terminus) fused to the repressor domain (C-terminus) (Liu et al. 2013).

Ribose porter.  RbsA has two ATPase domains fused together; RbsB is the substrate receptor; RbsC has 10 TMSs with N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm and forms a dimer (Stewart and Hermodson, 2003).  ABC importers can be divided into two classes. Type I importers follow an alternating access mechanism driven by the presence of the substrate. Type II importers accept substrates in a nucleotide-free state, with hydrolysis driving an inward-facing conformation.  RbsABC2 seems to share functional traits with both type I and type II importers, as well as possessing unique features, and employs a distinct mechanism relative to other ABC transporters (Clifton et al. 2014).

3.A.1.202.1	
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (also called ABCC7); cyclic AMP-dependent chloride channel; also catalyzes nucleotide (ATP-ADP)-dependent glutathione and glutathione-conjugate flux (Kogan et al., 2003) (may also activate inward rectifying K+ channels). The underlying mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis controls channel opening is described by Gadsby et al., 2006. The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is defective folding of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutant lacking Phe508 (DeltaF508)(Riordan, 2008). The DeltaF508 protein appears to be trapped in a prefolded state with incomplete packing of the transmembrane segments, a defect that can be repaired by direct interaction with correctors such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532 (Wang et al., 2007). CFTR interacts directly with MRP4 (3.A.1.208.7) to control Cl- secretion (Li et al., 2007). It has intrinsic adenylate kinase activity that may be of functional importance (Randak and Welsh, 2007). The intact CFTR protein mediates ATPase rather than adenylate kinase activity (Ramjeesingh et al., 2008). Regulated by Na+/H+ exchange regulatory cofactors (NHERF; O14745; TC #8.A.24.1.1) (Seidler et al., 2009). Regulated by protein kinase A and C phosphorylation (Csanády et al., 2010). It is also activated by membrane stretch induced by negative pressures (Zhang et al., 2010). TMS6 plays roles in gating and permeation (Bai et al., 2010; 2011). The 3-D structure revealed the probable location of the channel gate (Rosenberg et al., 2011). Conformational changes opening the CFTR chloride channel pore, coupled to ATP-dependent gating, have been studied (Wang and Linsdell, 2012). Alternating access to the transmembrane domain of CFTR has been demonstrated (Wang and Linsdell, 2012). MRP4 and CFTR function in the regulation of cAMP and beta-adrenergic contraction in cardiac myocytes (Sellers et al., 2012). An asymmetric hourglass, comprising a shallow outward-facing vestibule that tapers toward a narrow "bottleneck" linking the outer vestibule to a large inner cavity extending toward the cytoplasmic extent of the lipid bilayer has been proposed (Norimatsu et al., 2012). Small molecule CFTR potentiators and correctors that overcome the efects of deleterious mutations have been identified (Kym et al. 2018).  The intracellular processing, trafficking, apical membrane localization, and channel function of CFTR are regulated by dynamic protein-protein interactions in a complex network. Zhang et al. 2017 reviewed the macromolecular complex of CFTR, Na?/H? exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2; TC# 8.A.24.1.2), and lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) receptor 2 (LPA2; see TC# 9.A.14.2.5) at the apical plasma membrane of airway and gut epithelial cells

The ABCG5 (sterolin-1)/ABCG8 (sterolin-2) heterodimeric neutral sterol (cholesterol and plant sterols) (e.g., sitosterol) (phosphoryl donors ATP > CTP > GTP > UTP) exporter; present in the apical membranes of enterocytes and hepatocytes. Cholesteryl oleate, phosphatidyl choline and enantiomeric cholesterol are poorly transported (mutation of either ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause sitosterolemia and coronary atherosclerosis) (Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006; 2011). Involved in cell signalling, creation of membrane asymmetry and apoptosis (Quazi and Molday, 2011). The ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer (G5G8) mediates excretion of neutral sterols in liver and intestines. Mutations disrupting G5G8 cause sitosterolaemia, a disorder characterized by sterol accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. Lee et al. 2016 used crystallization in lipid bilayers to determine the X-ray structure in a nucleotide-free state at 3.9 A resolution. The structure reveals a new transmembrane fold that is present in a large and functionally diverse superfamily of ABC transporters. The transmembrane domains are coupled to the nucleotide-binding sites by networks of interactions that differ between the active and inactive ATPases, reflecting the catalytic asymmetry of the transporter (Lee et al. 2016). High expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 were observed in liver, the digestive tract and the mammary gland. The system plays roles in lipid and sterol intestinal absorption, biliary excretion, and lipid trafficking and excretion during lactation (Viturro et al. 2006).

Changing charged residues in TMS6 (K332, H335 and D336) gave rise to specific changes in specificity (Chen et al., 2006; Haimeur et al., 2002; Leslie et al., 2004).  Also, mutations in TMS 10 alter substrate binding and export of drugs (Zhang et al. 2006). MDR1 also exports cobalamine (Vitamin B12) (Beedholm-Ebsen et al., 2010) and cytotoxic metals including antimony, mercuric ions, arsenate and arsenite, but not copper, chromium, cobalt and aluminum, often as glutathione conjugates (Aleo et al., 2005; Vernhet et al., 2000). Notch1 regulates the expression in cultured cancer cells (Cho et al., 2011).  Structural and functional properties of MRP1 have been reviewed comprehensively (He et al. 2011).  Fluorescent substrates have been identified (Strouse et al. 2013).  It pumps out sulfur mustards and nitrogen mustards (mechlorethamine, HN2), potent vesicants developed as chemical warfare agents (Udasin et al. 2015). It has 3 membrane domains with a total of 17 TMSs. Loss of the aromatic side chain at position 583 impairs the release of ADP and thus effectively locks the transporter in a low-affinity solute binding state (Weigl et al. 2018).

3.A.1.209.1	
MHC heterodimeric peptide exporter (TAP) (from cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum) (TAP1=ABCB2; TAP2=ABCB3) (defects in TAP1 or TAP2 cause immunodeficiency) (TAP1/TAP2 is stabilized by tapasin isoforms 1, 2 and 3) (Raghuraman et al., 2002). TAP1 has 10 TMSs, 4 unique N-terminal TMSs and 6 TMSs that form the translocation pore with N- and C-termini in the cytosol (Schrodt et al., 2006). The TAP2 nucleotide binding site appears to be the main catalytic active site driving transport suggesting asymmetry in the transporter (Perria et al., 2006). The TAP complex shows strict coupling between peptide binding and ATP hydrolysis, revealing no basal ATPase activity in the absence of peptides (Herget et al., 2009).  There are three binding sites on TAP1 for tapasis which interconnects TAP and MHC class I, promotes TAP stability and facilitates heterodimerization (Leonhardt et al. 2014).  TAP is the target of GN1 (TC#8.B.25.1.1), a virally encoded protein inhibitor of viral peptide exposure on the cell surface (Verweij et al. 2008; Rufer et al. 2015). Tapasin (448 aas; O15533) stabilizes TAP2 (Papadopoulos and Momburg 2007). Tapasin is involved in the association of MHC class I with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and in the assembly of MHC class I with peptide (peptide loading). TAP plays a key role in the adaptive immune defense against infected or malignantly transformed cells by translocating proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. TAP transports peptides from 8 to 40 residues, including even branched or modified molecules, suggestive of structural flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket. The bound peptides in side-chains' mobility was strongly restricted at the ends of the peptide, whereas the central region was flexible. Peptides bind to TAP in an extended kinked structure, analogous to those bound to MHC class I proteins (Herget et al., 2011). TAP translocates proteasomal degradation products from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where these peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules by a macromolecular peptide-loading complex (PLC) and subsequently shuttled to the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As a central adapter protein, tapasin (O15533) (Li et al. 2000) recruits other components of the PLC at the N-terminal domains of TAP. Koch et al. 2006 found that the N-terminal domains of human TAP1 and TAP2 independently bind to tapasin, thus providing two separate loading platforms for PLC assembly. Tapasin binding is dependent on the first N-terminal TMS of TAP1 and TAP2, demonstrating that these two helices contribute independently to the recruitment of tapasin and associated factors (Koch et al. 2006). The endoplasmic reticulum-resident human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein US6 (gpUS6) inhibits peptide translocation by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to prevent loading of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. gpUS6 associates with preformed TAP1/2 heterodimers (Halenius et al. 2006).

The mitochondrial iron transporter, ATM1.  The crystal structures of the nucleotide-free and glutathione-bound inward facing, open conformations have been solved at 3.1 and 3.4 Å resolution respectively (Srinivasan et al. 2014).  The glutathione binding site is near the inner membrane surface in a large cavity.  An unknown sulfur compound appears to be exported by Atm1 and used for the synthesis of iron/sulfur centers in the cytoplasm.  This compound also signals iron sufficiency/deficiency to the nucleus (Philpott et al. 2012).

The NikM2 (230 aas; 5 TMSs)/NikN2 (110 aas; 2 TMSs) pair is part or all of a nickel transporter.  The crystal structure of NikM2 is known (PDB 4M5C; 4M58).  It possesses an additional TMS at its N-terminal region not present on other ECF transporter of known structure, resulting in an extracellular N-terminus. The highly conserved N-terminal loop inserts into the center of NikM2 and occludes a region corresponding to the substrate-binding sites of the vitamin-specific S component. Nickel binds to NikM2 by coordination to four nitrogen atoms in Met1, His2 and His67. These nitrogens form a square-planar geometry, similar to that of the metal ion-binding sites in the amino-terminal Cu2+- and Ni2+-binding (ATCUN) motif (Yu et al. 2013).  Constituents other than NikN2 and NikM2 are not known but may be required for activity (T. Eitinger, personal communication).

The L- and D-methionine porter (also transports formyl-L-methionine) (Zhang et al., 2003). The 3.7A structure of MetNI has been solved. An allosteric regulatory mechanism operates at the level of transport activity so increased intracellular levels of the transported ligand stabilize an inward-facing, ATPase-inactive state of MetNI to inhibit further ligand translocation into the cell (Kadaba et al., 2008).  The structure of an MetQ homologue in Neisseria meningitidis has been solved at 2.25 Å resolution revealing a bound methionine in the cleft between the two domains (Yang et al. 2009).

The biotin uptake system, BioMNY. The 3-d structure of the EcfS subunit, BioY, at 2.1Å resolution is known (Berntsson et al., 2012). BioY and ThiT from L. lactis show similar N-terminal structures for interaction with the ECF module but divergent C-terminal structures for substrate binding. BioY alone binds biotin but doesn''t transport it (Berntsson et al., 2012).  Ala-Arg-Ser and Ala-Arg-Gly signatures in BioN are probably coupling sites to the two BioM ATPase subunits (Neubauer et al., 2011).

Three component ABC L-glutamine porter. The basal ATPase activity (ATP hydrolysis in the absence of substrate) is mainly caused by the docking of the closed-unliganded state of GlnH onto the transporter domain of GlnPQ. Unlike glutamine, arginine binds both GlnH domains, but does not trigger their closing. Comparison of the ATPase activity in nanodiscs with glutamine transport in proteoliposomes suggested that the stoichiometry of ATP per substrate is close to two (Lycklama A Nijeholt et al. 2018).

Histidine/Arginine/Lysine (basic amino acid) uptake porter, HisJ/ArgT/HisP/HisM/HisQ [R, R, C, M, M, respectively] (Gilson et al. 1982). HisJ binds L-His (preferred), but 1-methyl-L-His and 3-methyl-L-His also bind, while the dipeptide carnosine binds weakly; D-histidine and the histidine degradation products, histamine, urocanic acid and imidazole do not bind. L-Arg, homo-L-Arg, and post-translationally modified methylated Arg-analogs also bind with the exception of symmetric dimethylated-L-Arg. L-Lys and L-Orn show weaker interactions with HisJ and methylated and acetylated Lys variants show poor binding.The carboxylate groups of these amino acids and their variants are essential (Paul et al. 2016).

The phenylpropeneoid uptake porter, CouPSTW.  The purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris is able to grow photoheterotrophically under anaerobic conditions on a range of phenylpropeneoid lignin monomers, including coumarate, ferulate, caffeate, and cinnamate. RPA1789 (CouP) is the periplasmic binding-protein component of the ABC uptake system (CouPSTU).  CouP binds a range of phenylpropeneoid ligands with K d values in the nanomolar range. The crystal structure of CouP with ferulate as the bound ligand shows H-bond interactions between the 4-OH group of the aromatic ring with His309 and Gln305. H-bonds are also made between the carboxyl group on the ferulate side chain and Arg197, Ser222, and Thr102 (Salmon et al. 2013).

Na+-translocating PPase (Malinen et al., 2007).  The 3-d resting state structure has been solved to 2.6 Å (Kellosalo et al. 2012).  The structure shows that the hydrolytic center is 20 Å above the membrane, coupled to the gate formed by the conserved Asp(243), Glu(246) and Lys(707) by an unusual "coupling funnel" of six a-helices. Helix 12 may slide down upon substrate binding to open the gate by a simple binding-change mechanism. Below the gate, four helices form the exit channel. Superimposing helices 3 to 6, 9 to 12, and 13 to 16 suggests that this PPases arose by gene triplication (Kellosalo et al. 2012).

Each  subunit consists of an integral membrane domain formed by 16 transmembrane helices.  imidodiphosphate is bound in the cytosolic surface of each subunit and trapped by numerous charged residues and five Mg2+ ions. A proton translocation pathway is formed by six core transmembrane helices. Proton pumping is initialized by PPi hydrolysis, and H+ is then transported into the vacuolar lumen through a pathway consisting of Arg242, Asp294, Lys742 and Glu301 (Lin et al. 2012).

3.A.2.1.1	
H+-translocating F-type ATPase. The loop-regions in subunits a and c that are implicated in H+ transport likely interact in a single structural domain which then functions in gating H+ release to the cytoplasm (Steed et al. 2014). Three different states that relate to rotation of the enzyme have been observed, with the central stalk's epsilon subunit in an extended autoinhibitory conformation in all three states (Sobti et al. 2016). The Fo motor consists of seven transmembrane helices and a decameric c-ring, and invaginations on either side of the membrane indicate the entry and exit channels for protons. The proton translocating subunit contains near parallel helices inclined by ~30 degrees to the membrane, a feature corresponding to rotary ATPases. This rotary ATPase subtype, the peripheral stalk, is resolved over the entire length of the complex, revealing the F1 attachment points and a coiled-coil that bifurcates toward the membrane with its helices separating to embrace subunit a from two sides (Sobti et al. 2016).

Na+-translocating F-type ATPase/ATP synthase of 8 subunits.  The Fo-a subunit plays a role in Na+ transport. It forms half channels that allow Na+ to enter and leave the buried carboxyl group on the Fo-c subunits. The essential Arg residue, R226, which faces the carboxyl group of Fo-c subunits in the middle of transmembrane helix 5 of the Fo-a subunit, separates the cytoplasmic side and periplasmic half-channels (Mitome et al. 2017). Residues that contribute to the integrity of the Na+ half channels have been identified; both half channels are present in the Fo-a subunit (Mitome et al. 2017).

H+-translocating F-type ATPase. Evidence of the proximity of ATP synthase subunit 6 is in proximity to the membrane in the supramolecular form (Velours et al., 2011).  The structure of the intact monomeric ATP synthase from the fungus, Pichia angusta, has been solved by electron cryo-microscopy (Vinothkumar et al. 2016). The Mg2+ and Ca2+-dependent enzymes are both active, but exhibit quite different behaviors (Nesci et al. 2017). Dimerization is necessary to create the inner membrane folds (cristae) characteristic of mitochondria.  Using cryo-electron microscopy, Guo et al. 2017 determined the structure of the dimeric FO complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a resolution of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the protons travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae. The crystal structure of the c-subunit ring with bound oligomycin revealed the inhibitor docked on the outer face of the proton-binding sites, deep in the transmembrane region (Zhou and Faraldo-Gómez 2018). A high resolution (3.7 Å) structure of the entire monomeric ATPase has been solved by cryo EM, suggesting how it is inhibited by oligomycin (Srivastava et al. 2018)

F-type ATPase.  The enzyme can synthesize but not hydrolyze ATP due to the presence of the zeta inhibitor.  The crystal structure is known (Morales-Rios et al. 2015).  The complex that was crystallized contains the nine core proteins of the complete F-ATPase complex plus the zeta inhibitor protein. The formation of crystals depended upon the presence of bound bacterial cardiolipin and phospholipid molecules; when they were removed, the complex failed to crystallize.

     H+-translocating V-type ATPase. The d-subunit couples ATP hydrolysis to H+ transport (Owegi et al., 2006).  The a subunit (Vph1p) most likely has an 8 TMS topology (Kartner et al. 2013; Knight and Behm 2012).  Structures for three rotational states show ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, setting the ATP:H+ ratio for proton pumping. Long tilted TMSs in the a-subunit interact with the c-ring.  V-ATPase's membrane sector, Vo, has been implicated in functions including membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release. Couoh-Cardel et al. 2016 reported that the purified V-ATPase c subunit ring (c-ring) forms dimers mediated by the c subunits' cytoplasmic loops. Electrophysiological measurements of the c-ring reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer revealed a large unitary conductance of ~8.3 nS.  A role of the c-ring in membrane fusion and neuronal communication was suggested (Couoh-Cardel et al. 2016).
     The three different maps reveal the conformational changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble catalytic region to the membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of the subunits undergo conformational changes during the transitions between these three rotational states (Zhao et al. 2015). The structures of these states provide direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth transmission of power through rotary ATPases. Increases in glucose stimulate V-ATPase assembly and activity while glucose deprivation triggers rapid V-ATPase disassembly and inactivation in yeast. However, the opposite phenomenon is observed in mammalian cells, specifically that V-ATPase assembly and activation increases when glucose is lost (Parra and Hayek 2018).
    The 3.5 Å resolution cryoEM structure of the lipid nanodisc-reconstituted Vo proton channel, captured in a physiologically relevant autoinhibited state, revealing the residues that constitute the proton pathway at the interface of the proteolipid ring and subunit a has been solved (Roh et al. 2018). The chemical basis of transmembrane proton transport was proposed. Roh et al. 2018 discovered that the C terminus of the assembly factor Voa1 (TC# 9.B.206.2.1)) is an integral component of the mature Vo. Voa1's C-terminal transmembrane alpha helix is bound inside the proteolipid ring, where it contributes to the stability of the complex. The structure rationalizes possible mechanisms by which mutations in human Vo can result in disease phenotypes.
    An arginine residue (Arg-735) in transmembrane helix 7 (TMS7) of subunit a of the yeast ATPase is known to be essential for proton translocation. Arginine residues are usually assumed to 'snorkel' toward the protein surface when exposed to a hydrophobic environment. However, Hohlweg et al. 2018 obtained evidence for the formation of a transient, membrane-embedded cation-p interaction in TM7 between Arg-735 and two highly conserved nearby aromatic residues, Tyr-733 and Trp-737. They proposed a mechanism by which the transient, membrane-embedded cation-p complex provides the necessary energy to keep the charged side chain of Arg-735 within the hydrophobic membrane. Such cation-p interactions may define a general mechanism to retain charged amino acids in a hydrophobic membrane environment (Hohlweg et al. 2018).

Type VI secretion system (T6SS) VasA-L + Vca0107-09; + Vca0123 + Vc1416 (Pukatzki et al., 2006; Pukatzki et al., 2007). This secretion system displays antimicrobial properties (Macintyre et al., 2010).  It functions like contractile tails of phage and penetrates cells with a trimeric VgrG spike protein to which are associated PAAR repeat proteins that sharpen the tip of the spike and are released into the cytoplasm of the target cell (Shneider et al. 2013).

3.A.24.1.1	
The RD1 (ESX-1) protein secretion complex (Type VII protein secretion system, T7SS).  EccA1 may be a secreted protein while ECCB1 - E1 may comprise the system (Houben et al. 2012).  This system (ESX-1) is present in the avirulent species, Mycobacterium smegmatis, where it is involved in conjugation (Coros et al. 2008).  ESX-1 uses the ESX-1-specific chaparone protein, EspG to interact with the secreted PE/PPE complex, while a homologous EspG specific for ESX-5 functions with the PE/PPE complex secreted by ESX-5.  Thus, EspG proteins may be system-specific chaparones for T7SSs (Daleke et al. 2012).  The main secreted virulence protein complex is a heterodimer: EsxA(ESAT-6)/EsxB(CFP-10) (Rosenberger et al. 2012). EccB, a periplasmic homoheximer with the ATP-binding active site shared by two adjacent subunits, may act as the energy provider in the transport of T7SS virulence factors and may be involved in the formation of a channel across the mycomembrane (Zhang et al. 2015). ESX-1 functions in resistance to and evasion of host responses.  It induces phagosomal rupture which releases bacteria into the cytosol of the host phagocytes (Gröschel et al. 2016). ESX-1 secrete EsxA and EsxB, which form a heterodimer, seem to have differing functions as EsxA can disrupt lipid bilayers (RBC and artificial membranes.  Thus EsxA may form pores as a prelude to membrane disruption (Gröschel et al. 2016).

The Type VII secretion system (T7SS or MPSS); the ESAT-6-like protein secretion system, ESX-5 (Abdallah et al., 2006; Sayes et al., 2012; Houben et al. 2012).  Mediates the secretion of the EsxN, PPE [pro-pro-glu motif] and PE_PGRS proteins (Deng and Xie 2012).  The EccB5, EccC5, EccD5 and EccE5 proteins form a membrane complex of about 1.5 MDa while EccA5 may be an exporter protein substrate (Houben et al. 2012).  PE25/PPE41form a heterodimer that is targeted to the T7SS, ESX5, by a C-terminal signal in PE25 which is necessary but not sufficient for targeting to ESX5 (Daleke et al. 2012).  An esx-5 mutant is strongly impaired in the uptake and utilization of hydrophobic carbon sources. Possibly the ESX-5 system is responsible for the transport of cell envelope proteins that are required for nutrient uptake (Ates et al. 2015).

3.A.3.1.1	
Na+-, K+-ATPase (Na+ efflux; K+ uptake).  Mutations in the ?-subunit causes renal hypomagnesemia, associated with hypocalciurea (Cairo et al., 2008). The Na/K-ATPase is an important signal transducer that not only interacts and regulates protein kinases, but also functions as a scaffold (Li and Xie, 2009). Capsazepine, a synthetic vanilloid, converts the Na, K-ATPase to a Na-ATPase (Mahmmoud, 2008a). There are alternative a- and ß-subunits, a1, a2,... ß1, ß2,... in muscle which form a1ß1, a1ß2, a2ß1 and a2ß2, heterodimers, each with differing Na+ affinities (4-13mM) (Kristensen and Juel, 2010). a3 and ß3 isoforms have also been identified. The ?-subunit is the same as TC# 1.A.27.2.1. Poulsen et al. (2010) have proposed a second ion conduction pathway in the C-terminal part of the ATPase. The two C-terminal tyrosines stabilize the occluded Na/K pump conformations containing Na or K ions (Vedovato and Gadsby, 2010). Na+, K+-ATPase mutations causing familial hemiplegic migraines type 2 (FHM2) inhibit phosphorylation (Schack et al., 2012). Salt, the vascular Na+/K+ ATPase and the endogenous glycosides, ouabain and marinobufagenin, play roles in systemic hypertension (Hauck and Frishman, 2012). Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of Ser936 (in the intracellular loop between transmembrane segments M8 and M9) opens an intracellular C-terminal water pathway leading to the third Na+-binding site (Poulsen et al., 2012). PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates activity in vivo. Ser-938 is located (Einholm et al. 2016). E960 on the Na+-K+-ATPase and F28 on phospholemman (PLM) are critical for phospholemman (PLM) inhibition, but there is at least one additional site that is important for tethering PLM to the ATPase. Mutations in the Na+/K+-ATPase a3 subunit gene (ATP1A3) cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, a rare movement disorder characterized by sudden onset of dystonic spasms and slow movements (Doganli et al. 2013).  The 3-d strcuture of the Na+-bound Na+,K+-ATPase at 4.3 Å resolution reveals the positions of the three Na+ ions (Nyblom et al. 2013).  Mutations cause adrenal hypertension (Kopec et al. 2014) as well as alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) and rapid-onset dystonia- parkinsonism (RDP) (Rosewich et al. 2014).  Differences in the structures of the ouabain-, digonxin- and bufalin-bound enzyme have been reported (Laursen et al. 2015).  ATPase inhibitors have been shown to be effective anti-cancer agents (Alevizopoulos et al. 2014). Cys45 in the ß-subunit can be glutathionylated, regulating the activity of the enzyme (Garcia et al. 2015). ATP1A2 mutations play a role in migraine headaches (Friedrich et al. 2016). The beta2 subunit is essential for motor physiology in mammals, and in contrast to beta1 and beta3, beta2 stabilizes the Na+-occluded E1P state relative to the outward-open E2P state (Hilbers et al. 2016). Numerous transcription factors, hormones, growth factors, lipids, and extracellular stimuli as well as epigenetic signals modulate the transcription of Na,K-ATPase subunits (Li and Langhans 2015). Cechová et al. 2016 have identified two cytoplasmic pathways along the pairs of TMSs, TMS3/TMS7 or TM6S/TMS9 that allow hydration of the cation binding sites or transport of cations from/to the bulk medium. Dissipation of the transmembrane gradient of K+ and Na+ due to ouabain inhibition increases Ptgs2 and Nr4a1 transcription by increasing Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels that, in turn, leads to CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of CREB and calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT, respectively (Smolyaninova et al. 2017). ZMay play a role in the development of gastric adenocarcinomas (Wang et al. 2017). Mutations F785L and T618M give rise to familial rapid onset dystonia parkonsonism by distinct mechanisms (Rodacker et al. 2006). Reacts with methylglyoxal to inhibit its activity (Svrckova et al. 2017).  Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by reduction of Na,K-ATPase functional activity. Petrushanko et al. 2016 showed that monomeric Abeta(1-42) forms a tight (Kd of 3 mµM), enthalpy-driven equimolar complex with alpha1beta1 Na,K-ATPase. Complex formation results in dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme hydrolytic activity. The binding site of Abeta(1-42) is localized in the """"""""gap"""""""" between the a- and ß-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, disrupting the enzyme functionality by preventing the subunits from shifting towards each other. Interaction of Na,K-ATPase with exogenous Abeta(1-42) leads to a pronounced decrease of the enzyme transport and hydrolytic activities and Src-kinase activation in neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. This interaction allows regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by short-term increases in the Abeta(1-42) level (Petrushanko et al. 2016). Two distinct phospholipids bind to two distinct sites on the ATPase, affecting activity and stability (Habeck et al. 2017). Five cysteinyl residues (C452, C456, C457, C577, and C656) serve as the cisplatin binding sites on the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices 4 and 5 (eflová et al. 2018).

H+-, K+-ATPase (gastric; H+ efflux; K+ uptake). Two H3O+ may be transported per ATP hydrolyzed.  Howeve, a cryo-electron microscope structure suggests that 1 H+ and 1 K+ are transporter per ATP hydrolyzed, providing the energy needed to generate the one million fold H+ concentration gradient effected by this enzyme (Abe et al. 2012).  The detailed mechanism has been discussed, and the roles of essential residues have been proposed (Shin et al. 2011).  A number of inhibitors of acid secretion have been identified, and these are of pharmacological importance (Shin et al. 2011). The catalytic alpha subunit has ten transmembrane segments with a cluster of intramembranal carboxylic amino acids located in the middle of TMSs 4, 5, 6 and 8. The beta subunit has one TMS with the N terminus in the cytoplasm. The extracellular domain of the beta subunit contains six or seven N-linked glycosylation sites. N-glycosylation is important for enzyme assembly, maturation and sorting (Shin et al. 2009).

SERCA of 1001 aas.  Several 3-D structures are known (e.g., 3W5B).  Molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence for the role of the Mg2+ and K+ bound states in the transport mechanism (Espinoza-Fonseca et al. 2014).  Animal SERCAs are inhibited by three short single TMS membrane proteins, phospholamban (TC# 1.A.50.1), sarcolipin (1.A.50.2) and myoregulin (1.A.50.3), and the inhibitory actions of these peptides on SERCA are counteracted by a peptide called DWORF (Dwarf ORF) (Nelson et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2015).  Norimatsu et al. 2017 have resolved the first layer of phospholipids surrounding the transmembrane helices. Phospholipids follow the movements of associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in thickness of the bilayer. The entire protein tilts during the reaction cycle, governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to minimize energy costs accompanying the large perpendicular movements of the transmembrane helices. A class of Arg residues extend their side chains through the cytoplasm to exploit phospholipids as anchors for conformational switching (Norimatsu et al. 2017).

Proton pumping ATPase, AHA2.  94% identical to AHA1 (3.A.3.3.7); generates the plasma membrane pmf.  Cation-binding pockets have been identified (Ekberg et al. 2010).  The pump has been reconstituted into "nanodiscs" in a functionally monomeric form (Justesen et al. 2013).  Regulated at the post-translation level by cis-acting auto-inhibitory domains, which can be relieved by protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation or binding of specific lipid species such as lysophospholipids (Wielandt et al. 2015).  Pumping is stochastically interrupted by long-lived (~100 seconds) inactive or leaky states. Allosteric regulation by pH gradients modulates the switch between these states but not the pumping or leakage rates (Veshaguri et al. 2016).  They dynamics of the pump have been examined (Guerra and Bondar 2015). AHA2 drives root cell expansion (Hoffmann et al. 2018).

Cu+-, Ag+-ATPase (efflux from the cytosol into the secretory pathway) (Barnes et al., 2005); ATP7B (Wilson's disease protein, a-chain) (continuously expressed in Purkinje neurons). It delivers Cu+ to the ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin, in liver. May also transport Fe2+ (Takeda et al., 2005). Critical roles for the COOH terminus of ATP7B in protein stability, trans-Golgi network retention, copper sensing, and retrograde trafficking have been reported (Braiterman et al. 2011).  Modeling suggests that Cu+-binding sites HMBDs 5 and 6 are most important for function (Gourdon et al. 2012).  ATP7B loads Cu+ into newly synthesized cupro-enzymes in the trans-Golgi network and exports excess copper out of cells by trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane.  Mutations causing disease can affect activity, stability or trafficking (Braiterman et al. 2014).  Cisplatin is a poor substrate relative to Cu+with a Km of 1 mµM, and copper and cisplatin compete with each other (Safaei et al. 2008).

Copper (Cu+) exporting P-ATPase, CopA (3-D structure known to 3.2 Å; PDB# 3RFU; Gourdon et al. 2011).  The internal surface of the ATPase interacts with the copper chaparone, CopZ (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2012).  A sulfur-lined metal transport pathway has been identified (Mattle et al. 2015).  Cu+ is bound at a high-affinity transmembrane-binding site in trigonal-planar coordination with the Cys residues of the conserved CPC motif of transmembrane segment 4 (C382 and C384) and the conserved Methionine residue of transmembrane segment 6 (M717 of the MXXXS motif). These residues are also essential for transport (Mattle et al. 2015).

3.A.3.5.6	
Cu+-ATPase, ATP7A (MNK or Mc1) (efflux from the cytosol into the secretory pathway) (Menkes disease protein, a-chain) (Tümer 2013). Expressed in Purkinje cells early in development and later in Bergmann glia. In melanocytes, it delivers Cu2+ to tyrosinase (Barnes et al., 2005). ATP7A has dual functions: 1) it incorporates copper into copper-dependent enzymes; and 2) it maintains intracellular copper levels by removing excess copper from the cytosol. To accomplish both functions, the protein traffics between different cellular locations, depending on copper levels (Bertini and Rosato, 2008). The lumenal loop Met672-Pro707 of copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A binds metals and facilitates copper release from the intramembrane sites (Barry et al., 2011).  Modeling suggests that Cu+-binding sites HMBDs 5 and 6 are most important for function (Gourdon et al. 2012).  In addition to X-linked recessive Menkes disease, mutations cause occipital horn syndrome and adult-onset distal motor neuropathy (Yi and Kaler 2014). p97/VCP interacts with ATP7A playing a role in motor neuron degeneration (Yi and Kaler 2018).

This protein has both N- and C- terminal metal binding domains (MBDs). The N-MBD exhibits a conserved ferredoxin-like fold, binds metals to CXXC, and regulates turnover. The C-MBD interacts with the ATP-binding (ATPB) domain and the actuator (A) domain (Agarwal et al., 2010).

K+-ATPase (uptake), KdpFABC. (KdpA is homologous to other K+ transporters such as KcsA (1.A.1.1.1), KtrB (2.A.38.4.2 and 2.A.38.4.3), and HKT (2.A.38.3.1 and 2.A.38.3.2); KdpB is homologous to P-ATPase a-subunits; KdpC and KdpF may facilitate complex assembly and stabilize the complex (Bramkamp et al., 2007; Haupt et al., 2005; Greie and Altendorf, 2007; Irzik et al., 2011). The KdpFABC acts as a functional and structural dimer with the two KdpB subunits in direct contact, but the enzyme can dissociate to the monomer (Heitkamp et al., 2008). KdpF is part of and stabilizes the KdpABC complex (Gassel et al., 1999).  Transcription of the kdp operon is activated by the KdpDE sensor kinase/response regulator pair, and unphosphorylated IIANtr of the PTS (TC# 4.A) binds KdpD to stimulate its activity, thereby enhancing kdp operon expression (Lüttmann et al. 2009, Lüttmann et al. 2015). Transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas putida kdpFABC operon by the KdpDE sensor kinase/response regulator by direct interaction of IIANtr of the PTS with KdpD has also been studied (Wolf et al. 2015). 
The 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB has been solved (Huang et al. 2017). The structure reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits: a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites, and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. A mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes was proposed (Huang et al. 2017).

General secretory pathway (Sec-SRP) complex.  A biphasic pulling force may act on TMSs during translocon-mediated membrane integration (Ismail et al. 2012).  Intermediate structures for the insertion of integral membrane proteins have been visualized (Bischoff et al. 2014).  Insertion of the Type II single span (N-terminus, in, C-terminus, out) protein, RodZ, requires only SecYEG, SecA and the pmf, but not SecB, SecDF, YidC or FtsY (Rawat et al. 2015).  The combined effects of ribosome and peptide binding to SecYEG may allow for co-translational membrane insertion of successive transmembrane segments (Ge et al. 2014). SecA penetrates deeply into the SecYEG channel during insertion, contacting transmembrane helices and periplasmic loops (Banerjee et al. 2017).

The general secretory pathway (Sec-SRP) complex. The Yet1 and Yet3 proteins interact directly with the Sec translocon (Wilson & Barlowe et al., 2010). The Sss1/Sec61? protein (80aas) has two domains. The cytosolic domain is required for Sec61p interaction while the transmembrane clamp domain is required to complete activation of the translocon after precursor targeting to Sec61p (Wilkinson et al., 2010). However, the apolar surfrace area determines the efficiency of translocon-mediated membrane-protein integration into the endoplasmic reticulum (Öjemalm et al., 2011). The essential Sec62, Sec63 and non-essential Sec66 and Sec72 proteins may comprise an SRP-independent tetrameric translocon enlisting the lumenal chaperone, BiP/Kar2 to ""ratchet"" its substrates into the ER (Feldheim and Schekman 1994; Ast et al. 2013). Cytosolic segments of the Sec61 complex important for promoting the structural transition between the closed and open conformations of the complex have been identified (Mandon et al. 2018). Positively charged residues in multiple cytosolic segments, as well as bulky hydrophobic residues in the L6/7-TMS7 junction may be required for cotranslational translocation or integration of membrane proteins by the Sec61 complex (Mandon et al. 2018).

Sec-SRP translocase complex. The BAP29 and BAP31 proteins interact directly with the Sec translocon (Wilson & Barlowe et al., 2010).  SRP68 and SRP72 form a complex with SRP RNA and SRP19.  The SRP68 binding site for the RNA is a tetratricopeptide-like module that bends the RNA and inserts an arginine-rich helix into the major groove to open the conserved 5f RNA loop and remodel the RNA for protein translocation (Grotwinkel et al. 2014).  Sec31 (Sec 31L1; HSPC334; HSPC275) is an outer cage component of the coat protein complex II (COPII) machinery which is recruited to specialized regions of the ER, called ER exit sites (ERES), where it plays a central role in the early secretory pathway. Sec31 also interacts with ALG-2 (Programed cell death protein 6 (PDCD6)) and annexin A11 (AnxA11) (Shibata et al. 2015). The Sec61 translocon mediates poorly efficient membrane insertion of Arg-containing TMSs, but a combination of arginine snorkeling, bilayer deformation, and peptide tilting is sufficient to lower the penalty of Arg insertion to an extent that a hydrophobic TMS with a central Arg residue readily inserts into a membrane (Ulmschneider et al. 2017). Mycolactone is a bacterium-derived macrolide that blocks the biogenesis of a large array of secretory and integral transmembrane proteins through potent inhibition of the Sec61 translocon (Morel et al. 2018). The Sec61a subunit possesses an opening between TMS2b and TMS7, the lateral gate, that is the exit for signal sequences and TMSs of translocating polypeptides to the lipid bilayer (Kida and Sakaguchi 2018).

Type III protein secretion complex. Assembly of the YscR,S,T,U,V complex occurs independently of other structural components and involves the formation of a YscV oligomer (Diepold et al., 2011). A C-terminal region of Yersinia pestis YscD binds the outer membrane secretin YscC (Ross and Plano, 2011). YopBD-mediated translocation of T3SS cargo, but not YopBD pore formation, leads to activation of host pathways influencing inflammation, cell death, and response to stress (Kwuan et al. 2013).

The Cag pathogenicity island (PAI) proteins (Kutter et al., 2008).  CagD (Cag24) is essential for CagA translocation and maximal induction of interleukin-8 secretion (Cendron et al., 2009). It is required for a pro-inflammatory response and multiple cytoskeletal and gene regulatory effects in gastric epithelial cells. Its molecular properties are described in a review by Fischer (2011). Cag16 (CagM) (of unknown function and not dermonstrably homologous to proteins of type IV secretion systems in other bacteria) has 3-4 TMSs and is essential for CagA export. It may therefore be a core protein of the Cag complex (Ling et al. 2013).

Mitochondrial protein translocase (MPT) (Chacinska et al., 2005; Mokranjac et al., 2005; Bihlmaier et al., 2007). The crystal structure of the intermembrane space domain of yeast Tim50 has been solved to 1.83 Å resolution (Qian et al., 2011). A protruding beta-hairpin of Tim50 is crucial for interaction with Tim23, providing a molecular basis for the cooperation of Tim50 and Tim23 in preprotein translocation to the protein-conducting channel of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Qian et al., 2011).  TIM23-mediates insertion of transmembrane a-helices into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Botelho et al., 2011). The TIM23 channel undergoes structural changes in response to the energized state of the membrane, the pmf (Malhotra et al. 2013).  TMS1 in TIM23 is required for homodimerization while it and TMS2 are involved in pre-protein binding in the channel (Pareek et al. 2013).  The Tom40 outer membrane channel may be a 19 ß-stranded barrel, possibly homologous to the VDAC porins (TC# 1.B.8) (Lackey et al. 2014).  Tim23 and Tim17 interact with each other as well as Tim44 and Pam17, respectively.  These last two proteins may serve regulatory functions (Ting et al. 2014).  Tom20, 22, 40 and 70 recognize presequences in various mitochondrially targetted proteins (Melin et al. 2015; Melin et al. 2014).  In the 4 TMS TIM17 protein, mutations in TMSs1 and 2 impair the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, whereas mutations in TM3 compromise binding of the import motor (Demishtein-Zohary et al. 2017); further, residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor were identified. TIM22, forms an intramolecular disulfide bond in yeast and humans.  If not oxidized, they do not properly integrate into the membrane complex, and the lack of Tim17 oxidation disrupts the TIM23 translocase complex (Wrobel et al. 2016). Mgr2 (TC# 1.A.111.1.3) and Pam18 are involved in precursormembrane protein quality control (Schendzielorz et al. 2018).

The vertebrate H+-translocating NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) complex (45 subunits) (Cardol et al., 2004).  The 3-d structure of the 44 subunit complex (14 core subunits present in bacteria, plus 30 additional subunits) with a molecular weight of 1 MDa, has been solved at 5 Å resolution by single particle electron cryo-microscopy (Vinothkumar et al. 2014).The core subunits contain eight iron-sulphur clusters and 60 transmembrane helices. The structures of many of the supernumerary subunits were determined or modeled. The structure provided insight into the roles of the supernumerary subunits in regulation, assembly and homeostasis.  One such subunit, GRIM-19 or NDUFA13, (Q9P0J0 of the human homologue) is essential for membrane potential formation and NADH assembly (Lu and Cao 2008).  Stroud et al. 2016 showed that 25 of the 31 accessory subunits in the 45 subunit human NADH dehydrogenase complex are required for assembly of a functional complex, and 1 subunit is essential for cell viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that loss of each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same structural module (Stroud et al. 2016). Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in humans is associated with combinations of individually non-pathogenic missense mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants, affecting the MT-ND4, MT-ND4L and MT-ND6 subunit genes of Complex I (Caporali et al. 2018).

The diheme-containing quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR), FrdABC (Madej et al. 2009).  This enzyme complex is required for fumarate respiration using formate or sulfide as electron donor.  It mediates transmembrane electron transfer by proton transfer via a compensatory transmembrane proton transfer pathway ('E-pathway') (Lancaster et al. 2008). This is necessary because, although the reduction of fumarate by menaquinol is exergonic, it is not exergonic enough to support the generation of a pmf. This compensatory E-pathway appears to be required by all dihaem- containing QFR enzymes. The conservation of an essential acidic residue on transmembrane helix V (Glu-C180 in W. succinogenes QFR) provides a key for the sequence-based discrimination of these QFR enzymes from the dihaem-containing SQR enzymes (Lancaster et al. 2008). This enzyme complex may mediate transmembrane electron transfer coupled to protolytic reactions on opposite sides of the membrane and by transmembrane protontransport (Madej et al. 2006).

Another structre (2.2 Å resolution) revealed conformational changes of helix positions from the previous structure solved at pH 8.5, and  internal water molecules interacting with residues implicated in proton translocation. Water flows across a narrow pore and a hydrophobic "dry" region in the middle of the membrane channel, with key residues His42alpha2 (chain A) being protonated and Thr214beta (chain B) displaying a conformational change, respectively, to gate the channel access to both cytoplasmic and periplasmic chambers. Mutation of Thr214beta to Ala deactivated the enzyme (Padayatti et al. 2017).

Ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase.  The cytochrome bc1 complex resides in the inner membrane of mitochondria and transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. This electron transfer is coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane by the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism. This mechanism topographically separates reduction of quinone and reoxidation of quinol at sites on opposite sites of the membrane, referred to as the center N (Qn site) and the center P (Qp site), respectively. Both are located on cytochrome b, a transmembrane protein of the bc1 complex that is encoded on the mitochondrial genome (Ding et al. 2006).

Cytochrome oxidase (Cox or CcO).  Reversible hydration-level changes of the cavity can be a key factor that regulates the branching of proton transfer events and therefore contributes to the vectorial efficiency of proton transport (Son et al. 2017). Cox16 is required for the assembly of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (respiratory chain complex IV (CIV)), possibly by promoting the insertion of copper into the active site of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2) (Cerqua et al. 2018; Aich et al. 2018).

Cytochrome ba3 oxidase, CbaABC. The 3-d structure is known (PDB# 1EHK) (Lee et al., 2012). Proton transfer has been reviewed (von Ballmoos et al., 2012). A mutation in subunit A, D372I, a probable pump H+ binding site, uncouples H+ transport from electron flow (von Ballmoos et al. 2015). In this cytochrome ba3, O2 molecules that arrive at the reduction site diffuse through the X-ray-observed tunnel, supporting its role as the main O2 delivery pathway in cytochrome this ba3 as well as the cytokchrome aa3 of Rhodobacter spheroides (Mahinthichaichan et al. 2018).

3.D.4.3.3	


Cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase (COX; Cbb3; CcoNOP).  The 3-d structure is known to 3.2 Å resolution (PDB# 3MK7; 5DJQ) (Buschmann et al. 2010; Lee et al., 2012).  The structure explains a proton-pumping mechanism and the high activity of family-C heme-copper oxidases compared to that of families A and B (Buschmann et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012). A small subunit of 36 aas and 1 TMS, CcoM, was identified in the structure and plays a role in assembly and stability (Kohlstaedt et al. 2016; Carvalheda and Pisliakov 2017). CcoQ, another small protein of 62 aas (acc # F8H837) is an assembly factor for Cbb3-1 and Cbb3-2 (Kohlstaedt et al. 2017). The A-, B- and C-type oxygen reductases each have an active-site tyrosine that forms a unique cross-linked histidine-tyrosine cofactor. In the C-type oxygen reductases (also called cbb3 oxidases), this post-translationally generated co-factor occurs in a different TMS than for the A- and B-type reductases (Hemp et al. 2006).

The proton pumping Caa3-type cytochrome oxidase chains A-F. The crystal structure (PDB: 2YEV) is known (2.36Å resolution; Lyons et al., 2012). It has a covalently teathered cytochrome c domain. In the cytochrome aa3, O2 molecules that arrive at the reduction site diffuse through the X-ray-observed tunnel, supporting its role as the main O2 delivery pathway in this cytochrome ba3 as well as the cytochrome aa3 of Rhodobacter spheroides (Mahinthichaichan et al. 2018).

3.D.4.6.2	
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX). 3-d structure known (PDB# 1M56) (Lee et al., 2012).  There are three hydrophobic channels connecting the hydrophobic membrane through the protein to the heme A3/CuB binuclear center (BNC), two of which are probably preferred for O2 diffusion (Oliveira et al. 2014). The D channel is the proton transporting channel, and mutations in residues along this channel, especially N139 in subunit 1, uncouple H+ transport from electron flow. Liang et al. 2017 provided insight into the decoupling mechanisms of CcO mutants, and explained how kinetic gating in the D-channel is imperative to achieving high proton-pumping efficiency in the WT CcO. The O2 molecules that arrived in the reduction site diffuse through the X-ray-observed tunnel, despite its apparent constriction, supporting its role as the main O2 delivery pathway in cytochrome aa3 (Mahinthichaichan et al. 2018).

Bacteriorhodopsin. Proton efflux occurs via a transient linear water-molecule chain in a hydrophobic section of the Brho channel between Asp96 and Asp85 (Freier et al., 2011).  It can be converted to a chloride uptake pump by a single amino acid substitution at position 85.  However, halorhodopsin (3.E.1.2.1), which pumps chloride ions (Cl-) into the cell, apparently does not use hydrogen-bonded water molecules for Cl- transport (Muroda et al. 2012).  Nango et al. 2016 used time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography and an x-ray free electron laser to visualize conformational changes in bRho from nanoseconds to milliseconds following photoactivation. An initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. The resulting cascade of structural changes throughout the protein shows how motions are choreographed as bRho transports protons uphill against a transmembrane concentration gradient. Nango et al. 2016 have created a 3-d movie of structural changes in the protein showing that an initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. Brho has light-independent lipid scramblase activity (Verchère et al. 2017). This activity occurs  at a rate >10,000 per trimer per second, comparable to that of other scramblases including bovine rhodopsin and fungal TMEM16 proteins. BR scrambles fluorescent analogues of common phospholipids but does not transport a glycosylated diphosphate isoprenoid lipid. In silico analyses suggested that membrane-exposed polar residues in transmembrane helices 1 and 2 of BR may provide the molecular basis for lipid translocation by coordinating the polar head-groups of transiting phospholipids. Consistent with this possibility, extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a BR trimer in a phospholipid membrane revealed water penetration along transmembrane helix 1 with the cooperation of a polar residue (Y147 in transmembrane helix 5) in the adjacent protomer. These findings suggest that the lipid translocation pathway may lie at or near the interface of the protomers of the BR trimer (Verchère et al. 2017). Retinal isomerization has been observed in the using a femtosecond x-ray laser (Nogly et al. 2018).

Sensory rhodopsin (green-light-activated photoreceptor; does not transport ions) (Jung et al., 2003). Has all-trans-retinal when dark adapted, but 11-cis-retinal when light adapted due to reversible interconversion (Sineshchekov et al., 2005).  Anabaena sensory rhodopsin, a photochromic sensor that interacts with a soluble 14-kDa cytoplasmic transducer that is encoded on the same operon, interconverts between all-trans-15-anti and 13-cis-15-syn retinal forms depending on the wavelength of illumination, although only the former participates in a photocycle with a signaling M intermediate (Dong et al. 2016). A mutation in the cytoplasmic half-channel of the protein, replacing Asp217 with Glu (D217E), results in the creation of a light-driven, single- photon, inward proton transporter. Dong et al. 2016 presented the 2.3 A structure of dark-adapted D217E ASR, which reveals changes in the water network surrounding Glu217, as well as a shift in the carbon backbone near retinal-binding Lys210, illustrating a possible pathway leading to the protonation of Glu217 in the cytoplasmic half-channel, located 15 A from the Schiff base.

Halorhodopsin Cl- uptake pump; homologous to bacteriorhodopsin (3.E.1.1.1) which can be converted from a proton pump with outwardly directed polarity into a chloride pump with inwardly directed polarity via a single amino acid substitution at position 85.  Cl- transport does not depend on water hydrogen bonded to the chromophore as in the case of bacteriorhodopsin (Muroda et al. 2012).  However, inter-helical hydrogen bonds, mediated by a key arginine residue, largely govern the dynamics of the protein and water groups coordinating the chloride ion (Jardón-Valadez et al. 2014).  Helices E and F probably move considerable during chloride binding and ion transport (Schreiner et al. 2016).

Proteorhopdopsin (exhibits variable vectorality: H+ is pumped out at basic pH but not at acidic pH; see Friedrich et al., 2002). Proteorhodopsin has been used to measure membrane potentials and electrical spiking in E. coli (Kralj et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2011).  3-d structures of three proteorhodopsins show that they can exist as pentamers or hexamers, depending on the protein (Ran et al. 2013).  Protonation states of several carboxylic acids, the boundaries and distortions of transmembrane a-helices, and secondary structural elements in the loops have been identified (Shi et al. 2009). Proteorhodopsin molecules incorporated into mesostructured silica films exhibit native-like function, as well as enhanced thermal stability compared to surfactant or lipid environments (Jahnke et al. 2018).

Na+ or H+ pumping bacteriorhodopsin, NaR, Kr2 or KR2.  It uses light to pump protons or sodium ions from the cell depending on the ionic composition of the medium. In cells suspended in a KCl solution, NaR functions as a light-driven proton pump, whereas in a NaCl solution, it exhibits light-driven sodium ion pumping, a novel activity within the rhodopsin family (da Silva et al. 2015).  A cation switch controls its conformations, and specific interactions of Na+ with the half-channels open an appropriate path for ion translocation (da Silva et al. 2015). Several high resolution x-ray structures have been solved (4XTO, Kato et al. 2015). Putative Na+ binding sites have been identified, and it was shown how protonation and conformational changes gate the ion through these sites toward the extracellular side (Suomivuori et al. 2017). Evidence for homology of this and other microbial rhodopsin with GPCR receptors including mamalian rhodopsins has been presented (Yee et al. 2013; Shalaeva et al. 2015).

Channelrhodopsin-1 (chlamyrhodopsin-3) (ChR1; Cop3; CSOA) (light-gated proton channel) (Nagel et al., 2003). TMSs 1 and 2 are the main structures involved in desensitization involving the stabilization of the protein's conformation and the alteration of the charge distribution around the retinal-Schiff base (Zamani et al. 2017).


PBDID: 3UG9
3.E.1.7.2	

Channelrhodopsin-2 (chlamyrhodopsin-4; ChR2; CR2; Cop4; CSOB) (light-gated cation-selective ion channel (both monovalent and divalent cations are transported)) (Nagel et al., 2003). Berndt et al. (2010) showed that ChR2 has two open states with differing ion selectivities. The channel is fairly nonspecific at the beginning of a light pulse, and becomes more specific for protons during longer periods of light exposure. Residues involved in channel closure have been identified (Bamann et al. 2010).  ChR2 is 712 aas long; the MR domain is N-terminal (Lee et al. 2015). The free energy profiles computed for proton transfer to the counterion, either via a direct jump or mediated by a water molecule, demonstrate that, when retinal is all-trans, water and protein electrostatic interactions largely favour the protonated retinal Schiff base state (Adam and Bondar 2018). 
   Blue light illumination of ChR2 activates an intrinsic leak channel conductive for cations. Sequence comparison of ChR2 with the related ChR1 protein revealed a cluster of charged amino acids within the predicted transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), which includes glutamates E90, E97 and E101. Charge inversion substitutions altered ChR2 function, replacement of E90 by lysine or alanine resulted in differential effects on H+- and Na+-mediated currents. These results are consistent with this glutamate side chain within TMS2 contributing to ion flux through and the cation selectivity of ChR2 (Ruffert et al., 2011). Glutamate residue-97 lies in the outer pore where it interacts with a cation to facilitate dehydration. This residue is also the primary binding target of Gd3+(Tanimoto et al., 2012).  Channelrhodopsin has been converted into a light-gated chloride channel (Wietek et al. 2014).  TMSs 2, 6 and 7 reorient or rearrange during the photocycle with no major differences near TMSs 3 and 4 at the dimer interface. TMS2 plays a key role in light-induced channel opening and closing in ChR2 (Müller et al. 2015).  Negative charges at the extracellular side of transmembrane domain 7 funnel cations into the pore (Richards and Dempski 2015).  CrChR2, is the most widely used optogenetic tool in neuroscience.  Water efflux and the cessation of the ion conductance are synchronized (Lórenz-Fonfría et al. 2015).  light and pH induce changes in the structure and accessibility of TMSB (Volz et al. 2016). Residues V86, K93 and N258 form a putative barrier to ion translocation. These residues contribute to cation selectivity (V86 and N258), the transition between the two open states (V86), open channel stability, and the hydrogen-bonding network (K93I and K93N) (Richards and Dempski 2017). The x-ray structure is available and reveals much about the mechanism of channel regulation (Gerwert 2017; Volkov et al. 2017).

4.A.1.1.1	
Glucose porter (PtsG; GlcA; Umg) (transports D-glucose and a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside).  The IIC domain has been crystallized, and x-ray data to 4.5 Å resolution have been described (Zurbriggen et al. 2010).  The system has been manipulated to engineer increased production of aromatic metabolites (Carmona et al. 2015, Vargas-Tah et al. 2015). The presence or absence of D-glucose reflects the transporter before and after release of the transported glucose into the cytoplasm. The transition associated with substrate release appears to require a subtle structural rearrangement in the region that includes hairpin 1 (Kalbermatter et al. 2017).  Mlc (for makes large colonies) represses transcription of the genes encoding enzyme I, HPr and EIIBCGlc in defined media that lack PTS substrates. When glucose is present, the unphosphorylated form of EIIBCGlc sequesters Mlc to the cell membrane, preventing its interaction with DNA (Plumbridge 2002, Joyet et al. 2013). The Vibrio Mlc functions similarly (Pickering et al. 2014). A small (43 aa) protein, SgrT, acts in tandem with a well-characterized small RNA during metabolic stress, due to the accumulation of cytoplasmic sugar-Ps to help bacterial cells maintain balanced metabolism and continue growing. SgrT acts on the glucose transport system, inhibiting its activity under stress conditions in order to allow cells to utilize alternative carbon sources (Lloyd et al. 2017).

Mannitol porter (MtlA) (mannitol-1-P forming), the mannitol IICBA complex.  The enzyme-transporter has been alterred genetically, sequenced, purified, reconstituted and characterized (Jacobson et al. 1983, Leonard and Saier 1983, Lee and Saier 1983, Manayan et al. 1988). Intramolecular phosphoryl transfer between the A and B domains of IIMtl is rate-limited by chemistry and not by the rate of formation or dissociation of a stereospecific complex in which the active sites are optimally apposed (Suh et al. 2007). Substrates, in addition to D-mannitol, include D-glucitol (D-sorbitol), D-2-amino-2-deoxymannitol, D-2-deoxymannitol and D-arabitol (D-arabinitol) (Jacobson et al. 1983).

Catalyzes xylose facilitated diffusion in lactobacilli. The order of D-sugar substrate affinities is: glucose > mannose > 2-deoxyglucose > N-acetylglucosamine > glucosamine > N-acetylmannosamine > mannosamine > fructose (Rephaeli and Saier 1980).  The mechanism appears to be rapid equilibrium, random, bi-bi sequential (Rephaeli and Saier 1980). L-sugars are not transported.

The L-ascorbate transporting and phosphorylating group translocator, SgaTBA or UlaCBA (SgaT = UlaA = YjfS; SgaB = UlaB = YjfT; SgaA = UlaC = PtxA = YjfU) (Hvorup et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). Two conformations of the 3-d structure have been determined at 1.65 and 2.35 Å resolution, respectively (Luo et al., 2015). UlaA (SgaT) forms a homodimer with a novel fold. Each UlaA protomer consists of 11 TMSs arranged into a 'V-motif' domain and a 'core' domain. The V motifs form the interface between the two protomers, and the core-domain residues coordinate vitamin C. Alternating access of the substrate to the two sides of the cell membrane may be achieved through rigid-body rotation of the core relative to the V motif (Luo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2003). This structure does not resemble the ChbC structure (TC# 4.A.3.2.8).

Cellulose synthase and transporter, BcsA, which functions with BcsB (periplasmic protein with an N-terminal TMS) and BcsC (an 18 ß-stranded outer membrane porin). The x-ray structure of the BcsA-B complex has been determined at 3.5 Å resolution (Morgan et al. 2013).  Cellulose is synthesized and secreted by the membrane-integrated cellulose synthase.  Substrate- and product-bound structures of BcsA provided the basis for substrate recognition and demonstrated the stepwise elongation of cellulose. Structural snapshots showed that BcsA translocates cellulose via a ratcheting mechanism involving a 'finger helix' that contacts the polymer's terminal glucose. Cooperating with BcsA's gating loop, the finger helix moves 'up' and 'down' in response to substrate binding and polymer elongation, respectively, thereby pushing the elongated polymer into BcsA's transmembrane channel. This mechanism was validated by tethering BcsA's finger helix, which inhibits polymer translocation but not elongation (Morgan et al. 2016).

The plant photosystem I (PSI) supercomplex at 3.4 Å resolution (Amunts et al., 2007). It contains 4 light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins as well as 13 additional constituents. One helix (TMS) proteins, OHP1 (O81208) amd OHP2 (Q9FEC1) play an essential role in the assembly or stabilization of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes, especially photosystem reaction centers, in the thylakoid membrane (Beck et al. 2017). PSI consists of two complexes, a reaction center and light-harvesting complex (LHC), which together form the PSI-LHC supercomplex. The crystal structure of plant PSI has been solved with two distinct crystal forms. The first, crystallized at pH 6.5, exhibited P21 symmetry; the second, crystallized at pH 8.5, exhibited P212121 symmetry. The surfaces involved in binding plastocyanin and ferredoxin were identical in both forms. The crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution revealed 16 subunits, 45 transmembrane helices, and 232 prosthetic groups, including 143 chlorophyll a, 13 chlorophyll b, 27 beta-carotene, 7 lutein, 2 xanthophyll, 1 zeaxanthin, 20 monogalactosyl diglyceride, 7 phosphatidyl diglyceride, 5 digalactosyl diglyceride, 2 calcium ions, 2 phylloquinone, and 3 iron sulfur clusters (Caspy and Nelson 2018). The model revealed detailed interactions, providing mechanisms for excitation energy transfer and its modulation in one of nature's most efficient photochemical machine.

The multihaem c-type cytochrome quinol:Fe3+ /Mn3 /4+ oxidoreductase, Cym/Mtr (Shi et al., 2007).  MtrABC is composed of two decahaem cytochromes brought together inside a transmembrane porin to transport electrons across the outer membrane to mineral based electron acceptors (White et al. 2012).  Conduction through MtrCAB directly to Fe(III) oxides occurs both in vitro in liposomes and in vivo, allowing anaerobic, solid-phase iron respiration (White et al. 2013). MtrC interacts with the surface of MtrAB, extending ~70 Å from the membrane surface and allowing the terminal hemes to interact with both MtrAB and an extracellular acceptor. MtrA fully extends through the length of MtrB, with ~30 Å being exposed into the periplasm. MtrCAB can reduce Fe(III) citrate with STC as an electron donor, disclosing a direct interaction between MtrCAB and STC (Edwards et al. 2018).

Potassium voltage-gated channel Isk-related family member 1, of 129 aas and one TMS, KCNE1 (Sahu et al. 2015).  Mutations can give rise to hearing disorders including chronic tinitus (Sand et al. 2010).  KCNE proteins modulate both homomeric Kv.2.1 and heteromeric Kv2.1/Kv6.4 channels (David et al. 2015). Slow-activating channel complexes formed by KCNQ1 and KCNE1 are essential for human ventricular myocyte repolarization, while constitutively active KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels are important in the intestine. Inherited sequence variants in human KCNE1 and KCNE3 cause cardiac arrhythmias by different mechanisms (Abbott 2015). KCNE confers pH sensitivity to KCNQ1 (Heitzmann et al. 2007).

Auxillary ß-subunit (ß2) of voltage-dependent and Ca2+ sensitive K+ channel (MaxiK; 1.A.1.3.2) The increased current reduces excitability (Wallner et al., 1999). 44% identical to TC#8.A.14.1.4). Full=BK channel subunit beta-2; Short=BKbeta2; Short=Hbeta2; AltName: Full=Calcium-activated potassium channel, subfamily M subunit beta-2; AltName: Full=Charybdotoxin receptor subunit beta-2; AltName: Full=Hbeta3; AltName: Full=K(VCA)beta-2; AltName: Full=Maxi K channel subunit beta-2; AltName: Full=Slo-beta-2. Coexpression of KCNMB2 with the human pore-forming alpha subunit of the large conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ channel (hSlo) yields inactivating currents similar to those observed in hippocampal neurons.  ß2 not only influences hSlo currents but also limits hSlo surface expression levels via an endocytic mechanism (Zarei et al. 2007).

8.A.16.2.1	
Transmembrane AMPA receptor (AMPAR) regulatory proteins, also called voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel ?2 subunits, TARP?2, CACNG2, gamma-2 or Stargazin; regulate Ca(v)2.2 (TC# 1.A.1.11.19) as well as GIRK (TC# 1.A.2.1.3) (Tselnicker and Dascal 2010). TARP?2 and TARP?7 (8.A.16.2.5) can substitute for each other (Yamazaki et al. 2015).  TARPs also enhance AMPAR function, altering ligand efficacy and receptor gating kinetics and shaping the postsynaptic response. Stargazin rescues gating deficiencies in AMPARs carrying mutations that destabilize the closed-cleft states of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), suggesting that stargazin stabilizes closed LBD states (MacLean et al. 2014).  For Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, stargazin enhances receptor function by increasing single-channel conductance, slowing channel gating, increasing calcium permeability, and relieving the voltage-dependent block by endogenous intracellular polyamines (McGee et al. 2015).  TARPs alter the conformations of pore-forming subunits and thereby affect antagonist interactions (Cokic and Stein 2008). By shifting the balance between AMPAR activation and desensitization, TARPs markedly facilitate the transduction of spillover-mediated synaptic signaling (Coombs et al. 2017).

8.A.17.2.2	
Sodium channel ß4 subunit. The beta4 cis dimer contributes to the trans homophilic interaction of beta4 in cell-cell adhesion, and may exhibit increased association with the alpha subunit (Shimizu et al. 2017). Thus, the cis dimerization of beta4 probably affects alpha-beta4 complex formation.

Dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type, Ca2+ channel subunit, Cav2.2, a2d subunit 1, CACNA2D1, NL2A, CCHL2A, MHS3.  An N-terminal region (the R-domain) is necessary and sufficient for Cav2.2 regulation (Song et al. 2015). This subunit is regulated at the transcriptional level by microRNA, MiR-183, which thereby regulates nociceptive basal and neuropathic pain (Peng et al. 2017).

Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VSCC) ß1-subunit, CACNB1 of 597 aas.  VSCCs are composed of different subunits, a1, ß, a2d and ?, among which the cytosolic ß subunit (Cavß) controls the trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane, its regulation and its gating properties. Many proteins interact with Cavß, suggesting a multifunctional role of these proteins. Some of the newly assigned functions of Cavß are independent of its role in the regulation of VGCC (Rima et al. 2016).

NHERF1; NHERF-1; EBP50; SlcA3R1.  Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) proteins are a family of PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-scaffolding proteins, three of which (NHERFs 1-3) are localized to the brush border in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells. All NHERF proteins are involved in anchoring membrane proteins that contain PDZ recognition motifs to form multiprotein signaling complexes.  These NHERF proteins exhibit differential mobility in membranes (Yang et al. 2013).  Sites involved in binding to NPT2A (TC# 2.A.58.1.1) have been identified (Mamonova et al. 2015).

Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF) or discs large homologue 4, PSD-95, PSD95, Dig4, Digh4, Dlg4 of 724 aas and 0 TMSs. Acts to stabilize and organize membrane targeting of multiple transmembrane proteins, including many clinically relevant drug transporters. These PDZ proteins are normally abundant at apical membranes, where they tether membrane-delimited transporters. NHERF expression is particularly high at the apical membrane in polarized tissue such as intestinal, hepatic, and renal epithelia, tissues (Walsh et al. 2015). DLG4 or PSD95 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of NMDA receptor subunits and shaker-type potassium channels and is required for synaptic plasticity associated with NMDA receptor signaling. Overexpression or depletion of DLG4 changes the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, DLG4 may reduce the amplitude of ASIC3 acid-evoked currents by retaining the channel intracellularly. It also regulates the intracellular trafficking of ADR1B and controls AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) immobilization at postsynaptic density, keeping the channels in an activated state in the presence of glutamate and preventing synaptic depression.  This involves palmitoylation (Jeyifous et al. 2016).

ß-amyloid cleaving enzyme I of the pepsin/retropepsin-like aspartyl protease superfamily.  BACE1 amplified reconstituted M-currents, altered their voltage dependence, accelerated activation, and slowed deactivation by physical association with channel proteins in a beta-subunit-like fashion (Hessler et al. 2015).  BACE1 has a unique sulfur rich motif (M462xxxC466xxxM470xxxC474xxxC478) in its TMS which is characteristic for proteins involved in copper ion storage and transport. This motif promotes BACE1 trimerization and binding of copper ions in vitro. It conducts copper ions through a constricted, partially solvated, axial pore. A central P472 induced kink enables copper ions to alternate between different coordination sites including the prominent C466 and M470 (Bittner et al. 2018).

The Slc3A2 (CD98hc; 4F2hc) accessory protein facilitates transport of amino acids and polyamines (putrescine/spermidine) (Uemura et al. 2008). 4F2hc stabilizes GLUT1 (2.A.1.1.28) and increase glucose transport activity (Ohno et al., 2011).  It forms a heterodimer with glycoprotein CD98 (LAT1; SLC7A5).  Contributes to tumorigenesis (Estrach et al. 2014).  CD98hc also modulates integrin signaling, plays a role in cell-to-cell fusion, and is essential for Brucella infection (Keriel et al. 2015). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exploits SLC3A2 for viral propagation, and upregulation of SLC3A2 may contribute to HCV-mediated pathogenesis (Nguyen et al. 2018).

a-Neurotoxin of 67 aas from the yellow scorpion, LqhIII.  Binds voltage-independently at site-3 of sodium channels and inhibits the inactivation of the activated channels, modulating inactivation by hindering voltage-sensor movement, thereby blocking neuronal transmission (Ma et al. 2013). Dissociation is voltage-dependent. This alpha-like toxin is highly toxic to insects and competes with LqhaIT on binding to insect sodium channels. Differs from classical anti-mammalian alpha-toxins as it inhibits sodium channel inactivation in cell bodies of hippocampus brain neurons, on which the anti-mammalian Lqh2 is inactive, and is unable to affect Nav1.2 in the rat brain, on which Lqh2 is highly active (Rowe et al. 2011).

Psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1) 40 aas (Diochot et al., 2007).  The Pi theraphotoxin Pc1a potently and selectively blocks the acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1a/ACCN2. The blockade is rapid and reversible. Psalmotoxin 1 loses its capacity to block ASIC1a/ACCN2 as soon as this subunit is associated with another member of the family (ASIC2a/ACCN1 or ASIC3/ACCN3). The toxin can distinguish between the two ASIC1/ACCN2 splice variants ASIC1a/ACCN2 and ASIC1b/ACCN2 (Chagot et al. 2004).  The presence of a 'disulfide through disulfide knot' structurally defines this protein as a knottin.  The 3-D structure is known (Chagot et al. 2005). This "gating blocker" mainly regulate ASIC1a gating through hydrogen bonds, which can affect the relative positions of several key domains in ASIC1a, and a long-range conformational change path was determined, which is composed of beta1, beta2, beta10, alpha6, alpha7, beta11 and beta12 in ASIC1a (Yu et al. 2017).

The monomeric structure consists of a long N-terminal a-TMS and a four-stranded C-terminal ß-sheet. Dimerization is mediated by an extended interface of hydrogen bond interactions between the a-helix and the four-stranded ß-sheet of the symmetry related molecule.

Shifts the voltage-dependence of channel activation to more positive potentials. Most potent against Nav1.8/SCN10A (Middleton et al. 2002; Priest et al. 2007).  A hydrophobic patch on the ProTx-II surface anchors it at the cell surface in a position that optimizes interaction of the peptide with the binding site on the voltage sensor domain. Binding of ProTx-II to the lipid membrane is directly linked to its potency as a hNaV1.7 channel inhibitor (Henriques et al. 2016).

8.B.9.1.1	
Cycseine-rich venom protein, Triflin.  Blocks contraction of smooth muscle elicited by high potassium-induced depolarization.  May also target voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav) in smooth muscle cells.  The crystal structure of triflin, a snake venom derived blocker of high K+-induced artery contraction has been solved at 2.4A resolution. Triflin consists of two domains. The first 163 residues form a large globular body with an aßa sandwich core which resembles pathogenesis-related proteins of group-1 (PR-1). Two glutamic acid-associated histidine residues are located in an elongated cleft. A Cd2+ resides in this binding site, and forms a five-coordination sphere. The subsequent cysteine-rich domain adopts a rod-like shape, which is stabilized by five disulfide bridges. Hydrophobic residues, which may obstruct the target ion channel, are exposed to the solvent. A concave surface, which is surrounded by these two domains, may play a role in the binding to the target receptor, leading to ion channel blockage. The C-terminal cysteine-rich region has a similar tertiary structure to voltage-gated potassium channel blocker toxins such as BgK and ShK (Shikamoto et al. 2005).

Putative lantibiotic (NAI-107) immunity exporter, MlbJ (247 aas; 6 TMSs)/Q (lipoprotein of 141 aas).  Distinct immunity determinants are: the ABC transporter MlbYZ, and acting cooperatively, the transmembrane protein, MlbJ, and the lipoprotein, MlbQ. NMR structural analysis of MlbQ revealed a hydrophobic surface patch which was proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic (Pozzi et al. 2015).

Neurotensin receptor type 1, Ntr1, of 418 aas and 7 TMSs.  G-protein coupled receptor for the tridecapeptide neurotensin (NTS). Signaling is effected via G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Signaling leads to the activation of downstream MAP kinases and protects cells against apoptosis (Da Costa et al. 2013).


PBDID: 2LYW
9.A.14.1.2	
Rhodopsin. Photoreceptor required for image-forming vision at low light intensity. Light-induced isomerization of 11-cis to all-trans retinal triggers a conformational change leading to G-protein activation and release of all-trans retinal. The tetraspanning peripherin-2 (TC# 8.A.40.1.2) links rhodopsin to a cyclic nucleotide-dependent channel (TC# 1.A.1.5.3) in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors.  The G266D retinitis pigmentosa mutation in TMS4 of rhodopsin abolishes binding of peripherin-2 and prevents association with the CNGA1/CNGB1a subunits present in the complex (Becirovic et al. 2014).  A channel through opsin, responsible for the passage of retinal from and to its central site where it forms a Schiff's base with a lysine in TMS7 has been proposed (Hildebrand et al. 2009). Blankenship et al. 2015 presented the 2.3-A resolution structure of native source rhodopsin stabilized in a conformation competent for G protein binding. An extensive water-mediated hydrogen bond network linking the chromophore binding site to the site of G protein binding was observed, providing connections to conserved motifs essential for GPCR activation.  Both Opsin and Rhodopsin serve as phospholipid flippases (scramblases) and thus have been implicated in photoreceptor disc membrane homeostasis (Menon et al. 2011; Goren et al. 2014; Ernst and Menon 2015;  Wang et al. 2018). One particular conformation of rhodopsin is an open channel connecting the ligand binding site with the membrane and the intradiscal lumen of rod outer segments. Sufficient in size, the passageway permits the exchange of hydrophobic ligands such as retinal (Mattle et al. 2018).

It plays a role in various processes in adults such as regulation of blood pressure, heart contractility, and heart failure. During heart formation, it acts as a receptor for elabela hormone (ELA). It influences cell movement during embryonic development and serves as an alternative coreceptor with CD4 for HIV-1 infection (Pauli et al. 2014); it may be involved in the development of AIDS dementia.

9.A.14.13.17	
Chemokine receptor type 4, CXCR4 of 352 aas and 7 TMSs.  The majority of essential residues form a continuous intramolecular signaling chain through the transmembrane helices.  This chain connects chemokine binding residues on the extracellular side of CXCR4 to G protein-coupling residues on its intracellular side. Integrated into a cohesive model of signal transmission, these CXCR4 residues cluster into five functional groups that mediate (i) chemokine engagement, (ii) signal initiation, (iii) signal propagation, (iv) microswitch activation, and (v) G protein coupling. Propagation of the signal passes through a "hydrophobic bridge" on helix VI (Wescott et al. 2016).

9.A.14.13.18	
Mu-type opioid receptor of 400 aas and 7 TMSs, OprM1. Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin and endomorphin and for natural and synthetic opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl, etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity as well as both N-type and L-type calcium channels, and activation of inward rectifying potassium channels (Knapman and Connor 2015). Activation of the astrocytic µ-opioid receptor elicits fast glutamate release through TREK-1-containing K2P channel in hippocampal astrocytes (Woo et al. 2018).

9.A.14.3.8	
Adenosine A2a receptor of 412 aas and 7 TMSs. It is a lipid flippase and a water channel (see below). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase.  The crystal structure has been solved revealing a continuous water channel (Yuan et al. 2015).  Tryptophan-246 in TMS6 forms the gate. Conformational changes in TMSs 6 and 7 produce local changes in the lipid bilayer (Yuan et al. 2015).  The protein can function as an ATP-independent phopholipid flippase (scramblase) (Goren et al. 2014). Yuan et al. 2015 found that the conserved W246(6.48) residue in transmembrane helix TM6 performs a key rotamer toggle switch. Agonist binding induces the sidechain of W246(6.48) to fluctuate between two distinct conformations, enabling the diffusion of water molecules from the bulk into the center of the receptor. After passing the W246(6.48) gate, the internal water molecules induce another conserved residue, Y288(7.53), to switch to a distinct rotamer conformation establishing a continuous transmembrane water pathway. Further, structural changes of TM6 and TM7 induce local structural changes of the adjacent lipid bilayer (Yuan et al. 2015).

The dopamine receptor D3, DRD3, of 400 aas.  Residues involved in receptor signaling have been identified (Kota et al. 2015), and several agonists are known (Xu et al. 2016). The atomic-level dopamine activation mechanism for transmitting extracellular ligand binding events through transmembrane helices to the cytoplasmic G protein has been elucidated (Weng et al. 2017). In agonist-bound systems, the D3R N-terminus forms a "lid-like" structure and lies flat on the binding site opening, whereas in antagonist-bound systems, the N-terminus exposes the binding cavity. A continuous water pathway is present only in the dopamine-Galphai-bound system. In the inactive D3Rs, water entry is hindered by the hydrophobic layers. It was proposed that upon agonist binding, the "lid-like" conformation of the N-terminus induces a series of molecular switches to increase the volume of the D3R cytoplasmic binding part for G protein association. Water enters the transmembrane region, inducing molecular switches to assist in opening the hydrophobic layers to form a continuous water channel, which is crucial for maintaining a fully active conformation for signal transduction (Weng et al. 2017).

Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1, CRHR1. The structure is known (Hollenstein et al. 2013). Structural changes in CRFR1 upon antagonist binding and the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms have been investigated (Latek 2017). This G-protein coupled receptor for CRH (corticotropin-releasing factor) and UCN (urocortin) has high affinity for CRH and UCN. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and down-stream effectors such as adenylate cyclase. CRHR1 promotes the activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels. It inhibits the activity of the calcium channel CACNA1H (TC# 1.A.1.11.5) (Tao et al. 2008). Required for normal embryonic development of the adrenal gland and for normal hormonal responses to stress. Plays a role in the response to anxiogenic stimuli.

The binding of cytokines and growth factors to heparan sulfate (HS) chains on proteoglycans generates gradients that control development and regulate wound healing. Syndecan-1 (sdc1) is an integral membrane HS proteoglycan. Its structure allows it to bind with cytosolic, transmembrane, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It plays important roles in mediating key events during wound healing because it regulates a number of important processes, including cell adhesion, cell migration, endocytosis, exosome formation, and fibrosis (Stepp et al. 2015).

Erythrocyte Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase 1, PLSCR1, of 318 aas and 1 or 2 C-terminal TMSs.  The C-terminal helix (CTH) inserts into the membrane via charge interactions but does not oligomerize in the membrane. The CTH is thus required for membrane insertion, Ca2+ coordination and the functional conformational changes that result in lipid scrambling (Francis et al. 2013).  The C-terminal region binds cholesterol (Posada et al. 2014). The role of this protein in phospholipid scrambling has been questioned (Sahu et al. 2007; Sivagnanam et al. 2017).

9.B.1.1.1	
The CAAX prenyl protease CAAX PP.  The 3-d structure (2.0 Å resolution) revealed a seven TMS a-helical barrel structure surrounding a large water-filled intramembrane chanber capped by a zinc metalloprotease domain with the catlytic site facing into the chamber.  Mutations cause laminopathies (Quigley et al. 2013). results showed: (1) a detailed view of the active site of ZMPSTE24, including water coordinating the catalytic zinc; (2) enhanced visualization of fenestrations providing access from the exterior to the interior cavity of the protein; (3) a view of the C-terminus extending away from the main body of the protein; (4) localization of ordered lipid and detergent molecules at internal and external surfaces and also projecting through fenestrations, and (5) water molecules associated with the surface of the internal cavity (Clark et al. 2017).

9.B.104.1.1	
GlpG rhomboid serine protease (276aas ; 6 TMSs; DUF3582; Structure known) (Vinothkumar, 2011; Wang et al. 2006). The requirements for cleavage have been defined (Akiyama and Maegawa 2007). The catalytic Ser201 located at the N terminus of TMS 4, approximately 10 Å below the membrane surface. Access to water molecules is provided by a central cavity that opens to the extracellular region and converges on Ser201. One of the two GlpG molecules in the asymmetric unit has an open conformation at the active site, with TMS 5 bent away from the rest of the molecule. Substrate entry to the active site is probably gated by the movement of TMS 5 (Wu et al. 2006).

9.B.104.1.7	
Rhomboid protease (peptidase) of 192 aas and 6 TMSs, GlpG. The structure has been solved at 2.2 Å resolution, revealing the relative disposition of the nucleophilic serine to the general base/acid function of the conserved histidine (Lemieux et al. 2007). The active site is inside the membrane, but near the surface, to release the hydrophilic ectodomain of its single TMS substrate. These enzyme may thin the membrane, allowing access of water to te active site. There is a cavity adjacent to the cleavage site containing ordered water molecules, involved in access to the substrate before cleavage (Sanders and Hutchison 2018).

PBDID: 2MDK

PBDID: 3IKK
9.B.174.1.1	
The C-terminal processing protease, CtpB (YvjB). Crystal structures reflecting distinct functional states show that CtpB constitutes a ring-like protein scaffold penetrated by two narrow tunnels. Access to the proteolytic sites sequestered within these tunnels is controlled by PDZ domains that rearrange upon substrate binding. Accordingly, CtpB resembles a minimal version of a self-compartmentalizing protease regulated by a unique allosteric mechanism (Mastny et al. 2013).  May show limited sequence similarity with 8.A.24.1.1.  The transmembrane domain serves as a receptor for the LsbB bacteriocin in Lactococcus lactis (Miljkovic et al. 2016).

The metastatic lymph node-64 (MLN-64; MLN64; STARD3; CAB1) protein mediates endosomal cholesterol transport to mitochondria and the plasma membrane (Kennedy et al. 2014). It has been implicated in toxin-induced resistance. Down-regulation of MLN64 in Niemann-Pick C1 deficient cells decreased mitochondrial cholesterol content, suggesting that MLN64 functions independently of NPC1 (Balboa et al. 2017), and overexpression increases the mitochondrial cholesterol content and decreases the mitochondrial glutathione content, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Balboa et al. 2017).
